Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay (2) and said: \"It would seem that inspite of the slightly different language of the Excess Profits Tax Act from that of the Income-tax Act, no distinction has ever been drawn in this matter between the principles governing assessment to income-tax and the principles governing assessment to excess profits tax and in fact it would appear to have been the universal (1) (1959) 36 I.T.R, 1.\n(2) (1956)30I.T.R.849,          practice that decisions of the Income-tax authorities and High Courts have been followed by consequential orders relating to the same assessee's taxable income for the purpose of the Excess Profits Tax Act and the learned counsel for the Commissioner has not been able to cite any decision in which different principles have been applied in this particular matter.", "Admittedly one of the reasons given in his judgment by Chagla C.J.\n          for coming to the decision mentioned above 'was that the third proviso had been changed in the Business Profits Tax Act as compared with the Excess Profit-, Tax Act, but this is only one of a number of reasons and the questions has not been considered at all whether under the proviso in the Excess Profits Tax Act losses made in an Indian State could have been computed in assessing the assessee's income from business in British India.", "I can only say that in the circumstances it seems to me likely that if the point had arisen the same view that I.\n          have expressed above would have been taken, namely, that whereas for the excess profits tax profits earned in an Indian State could not be taken into consideration at all, such profits could be taken into account if brought into taxable territories for assessing profits tax and that is regards losses.", "they I could be taken into account in assessing the business whether they occurred in a State. or in what was British India.\"", "\nThe second ground given by the High Court depended on the facts found.", "The High Court expressed the view that, on the facts found it was doubtful if the losses in question could be deemed to have occurred in Bhatinda.", "\nIt said \"It is not in dispute that the only place where the assessee carries on business is Delhi and that its transactions in other markets are carried out by means of commu- nication by telephone or Post.", "There is no Suggestion that the firm has any agent or branch in any native State and it therefore seems to me that whether profits result or losses are incurred as the result of transac- tions of this kind even with firms in Indian States, the profits accrue or the losses are incurred at the place where the payments are received or from which they are made, namely, the firm's place of business at Delhi.\"", "\nOn behalf of the appellant it is contended that both the aforesaid grounds given by the High Court for the answer which it gave to the second question are unsubstantial.", "\nThe, first ground, it is contended, is untenable in law, and the second.", "proceeds not on the findings of fact arrived at by the Tribunal but on new findings made by the High Court, which course was not open to the High Court to take.", "\nWe consider that these contentions are correct.", "As to the first ground, it seems clear to us that under the third proviso to s.5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 where the profits etc., of a part of the firm's business accrued or arose it Bhatinda, that part of the, business shall for the purpose of the said section be deemed to be a separate business.", "If that is so the losses which arose at Bhatinda must also be the losses of a separate business.", "We may here read s.5 and the third proviso thereto : .lm15 \" s. 5.", "This act shall apply to every business of which any part of the profits made during the chargeable accounting period is chargeable to income-tax by virtue of the provisions of sub-clause (i) on sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of subsection (1) of section 4 of theIndian Income-tax Act, 1922, or of clause (c) of that sub-section : Provided further that this act shall not apply to any business the whole of the profits of which accrue or arise in an Indian State and where the profits of a part of a business accrue or arise in an Indian State, such part shall, for the purposes of this provision, be deemed to be a separate business the \",hole of the profits of which accrue or arise in an Indian State and the other part of the busi- ness shall, for all the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be, a separate business.\"", "In Commissioner of Income-tax v. Karamchand Premchand Ltd.(1).", "This Court considered s. 5. of the Business Profits Tax Act, 1947 and pointed out the distinction between the third proviso thereto and the third proviso to s. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1.940.", "This Court quoted. with approval the decision in Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax, Bombay City v.

Patel Bombay (2 ) and held that the language used in the third proviso to S. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 was one of exclusion and that Act did not apply to profits etc. of that part of the business which arose in an Indian State.", "If that part of the business has to be treated as a separate business for the purposes of the Excess Profits Tax Act, it is difficult to see how the losses incurred in an Indian State can be taken into consideration for the same purposes.", "We think that the High Court was in error in thinking that the third proviso to s. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act did not touch the question which the High Court had to answer.", "On the (2) (1952) 21 I.T.R. 72, (1) (1960) 40 I.T.R. 106.contrary, we think that the proviso answers the question against the assessee.", "Now, as to the second ground given by the High Court.", "It seems to us that there can be no doubt that the assessing authorities proceeded on the footing that the losses for which the assessee firm claimed a deduction arose and were incurred at Bhatinda, even though the firm's place of business was Delhi.", "The Income-tax Officer, as also the Appellate Assistant Commissioner referred to s. 14(2)(c ) of the Income-tax Act, 1922; that provision related to income, profit-, or gains accruing or arising in an Indian State.", "\nThe assessing authorities proceeded on the footing that as the proof its we are exempt from tax in terms of s.\n14(2)(c), the losses arising out-. side the taxable territories could not be taken into account.", "The Tribunal did not rely on s. 14(2)(c), nor on the proviso to s. 24 (1) of the Income-tax Act, 1922.", "But it relied on s.42.", "That again shows that it proceeded on the footing that though the income actually arose outside the taxable territories, it should be deemed to have arisen with in the taxable territories by reason of its business connection in the taxable territories.", "The High Court had to answer the second question on the facts found; it could not.arrived at fresh findings of fact.", "Such a course was not open to it.", "\nIndeed, it is true that the Tribunal said that the firm's transactions could not be split up, but the actual decision of the tribunal proceeded on the basis that.", "even it the transactions could be split up, s.42 applied and the income actually arising at Bhatinda would be deemed to have arisen in the taxable territories and so the losses must be taken into consideration for arriving at the income.", "The Tribunal considered the matter solely from the point of view of the assessment of income-tax.", "It did not consider the third proviso to s. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 and what effect it had in the matter of the assessment of' excess profits tax.", "We agree that if the incomedid not arise or accrue in Bhatinda but the whole of it arose in Delhi, the third proviso would have no application.", "\nIf however, part of the income etc. arose in Bhatinda, there that part of the business was a separate, business for the purposes of the Excess Profits Tax Act and the losses' incurred at Bhatinda could not be taken into account.", "We are of the view that on the facts found, the answer to the second question must be in favour of the appellant and against the assessee.", "Civil Appeal No. 40 of 1960 must, therefore, be allowed.", "\nThe two appeals were heard together and in view of the divided success of the parties, the parties must bear their own costs in both appeals.", "\nCivil Appeal No. 39 dismissed.", "\nCivil Appeal No 40 allowed,"]}, {"labels": [0, 0, 0, 12, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 12, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 12, 12, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 12, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12], "segments": ["                                                                REPORTABLE\n IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA", "\nCRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n                CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 45 OF 2020\n(ARISING OUT OF SLP (CRIMINAL) NO. 4977 OF 2019)", "STATE REP.

been brought to our notice as to how an enquiry before the registration of a case can be held to be investigation.", "The matter, however, need not be dilated upon and it is not necessary to express

breach of provisions of section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the result of the trial cannot be set aside unless the illegality in the investigation can be shown to have brought about a miscarriage of justice.", "The underlying reason for the above dictum is that an illegality committed in the course of investigation does not affect the competence and jurisdiction of the court to try the accused.", "Where, therefore, the trial of the case has proceeded to termination, the invalidity of the proceeding investigation would not vitiate the conviction of the accused as a result of the

Shanmugham (PW6) conducted the postmortem.", "He stated that he could not say with certainty what was the cause of death but it was possible by drug injection.", "Venki was arrested in connection with the said crime and he allegedly made a confessional statement to the police on 08.11.2004 which led to the discovery of Tidijesic syringe, empty ampoules, unused Tidijesic ampoule etc..", "PW1, the maternal uncle of the deceased, filed a petition in the High Court of Madras in February, 2005 seeking transfer of the investigation to some other agency since he was not happy with the manner in which the case was being investigated.", "The High Court vide order dated 28.02.2005 transferred the investigation to the CB CID, Tamil Nadu.", "There were three suspects before the police viz., Venkatesh @ Venki, Sivaprakash @ Siva and Chandrasekaran @ Chandru.", "\nAll three were subjected to Polygraph, Brainmapping and Narcoanalysis tests at a Forensic Science Laboratory.", "According to the Investigating Officer (DW4), who carried the investigation, the two appellants herein cleared the said tests and there was no suspicion against them since they disclosed no signs of deception.", "However, during the tests, Venki's answers were found deceptive.", "\n 6. In the year 2006, PW5, father of the deceased, filed a petition in the Madras High Court for transferring the investigation of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).", "This petition was rejected by the High Court on 08.02.2008.", "Meanwhile, on 23.01.2008, more than three years after the incident, a chargesheet was filed by the CB CID under Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short `CrPC') only against Venkatesh @ Venki under Section 304 Part II of the Indian Penal Code (for short `IPC').", "The present accused (appellants herein) were cited as prosecution witnesses in the said chargesheet.", "Venki died after the filing of the chargesheet but before trial of the case on 21.07.2008.\n 7.", "It was only thereafter that PW1, maternal uncle of the deceased, filed a private complaint before the court which is Exhibit P1.", "In this complaint it was stated that the two accused and the deceased had stayed in Room No. 203 and Venki came to the room at the invitation of the accused Chandru.", "Venki was a drug peddler and Arun was not in the habit of taking drugs.", "On the request of the accused, Venki had injected 4 ml of Tidijesic injection in the left wrist of the deceased.", "It was also alleged that Venki was paid Rs.50/ by the accused Siva for his services.", "\nAccording to this complaint, Arun had been injected for the second time in the left arm inner portion.", "When this witness went to the room No. 203, Venki was present and told the complainant that the accused had given excess narcotic drugs on the left inner portion of the arm due to which the deceased died.", "\nIn the complaint it was also stated that immediately after he had visited the guest house on 31.10.2004, he had gone to the Triplicane Police Station, where the police forcibly obtained his signatures on two blank papers.", "It was alleged that the FIR was lodged by the police in connivance with the two accused.", "In this complaint it is also mentioned that there were marks of injecting two injections and, according to the report of the Forensic Science Laboratory, a huge amount of narcotic substance had been injected into the deceased which caused his death.", "In this complaint it was also alleged that the accused Siva had close association with PW10 (hereinafter referred to as `R').", "According to the complainant, R (PW10) was introduced to the deceased Arun and they used to regularly talk to each other on phone every day and therefore, accused Siva could not tolerate that his girlfriend should shift loyalty to some other person.", "Therefore, he approached Chandru, who was a student in a medical college and with his help injected excess dose of Tidijesic with the intention of killing Arun.", "8. After the filing of the private complaint, the metropolitan magistrate recorded the statements of seven witnesses and found sufficient grounds for proceeding with the case under Section 302 IPC.", "Thereafter, the case was committed to the Court of Sessions and charges were framed against the accused, who pleaded not guilty.", "The evidence of the witnesses were recorded.", "\nAccused also examined four witnesses.", "The trial court convicted the accused for having committed the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC read with Section 120B IPC and sentenced them to undergo life imprisonment.", "Aggrieved, the accused filed two separate criminal appeals, which have been dismissed.", "Hence, the present appeals.", "\n 9. Admittedly, there are no eyewitnesses to the case and this is a case based on circumstantial evidence.", "The law with regard to appreciation of circumstantial evidence has been clearly enunciated in the case of Hanumant v. State of Madhya Pradesh1, wherein this Court held as follows: \"10......It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established, and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.", "Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.", "In other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.\"", "\n 10. This law has been consistently followed and has been repeated in catena of authorities.", "It is not necessary to refer to all the authorities.", "However, we may refer to Sir Alfred Wills book Wills on Circumstantial Evidence (Chapter VI)2, in which he has laid down the following Rules specially to be observed in the case of circumstantial evidence: \"RULE 1.  The facts alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be clearly proved, and beyond reasonable doubt connected with the factum probandum............\n 1 AIR 1952 SC 343 2 Butterworths, Seventh Edition, Pp 296-329.\n RULE 2.  The burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the existence of any fact which infers legal accountability................\n                  RULE 3.", " In all cases, whether of direct or circumstantial evidence, the best evidence must be adduced which the nature of the case admits.........\n                  RULE 4.  ", "In order to justify the inference of guilt, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused, and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt..................", "\n                  RULE 5.", " If there by any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, he is entitled as of right to be acquitted.\"", "\n 11. The law can be summarised in the following terms: 1. The circumstances relied upon by the prosecution which lead to an inference to the guilt of the accused must be proved beyond doubt; 2. The circumstances should unerringly point towards the guilt of the accused; 3. The circumstances should be linked together in such a manner that the cumulative effect of the chain formed by joining the links is so complete that it leads to only one conclusion i.e. the guilt of the accused; 4. That there should be no probability of the crime having been committed by a person other than the accused.", "12. It is in the light of the aforesaid law that we have to consider the evidence and the circumstances relied upon by the courts below.", "\n 13. In a case based on circumstantial evidence it is always better for the courts to deal with each circumstance separately and then link the circumstances which have been proved to arrive at a conclusion.", "Unfortunately, in this case, though a reference has been made to some circumstances, the circumstances have not been discussed separately.", "Therefore, we propose to discuss the various circumstances relied upon by the prosecution: 1.", "LAST SEEN TOGETHER", "As far as this circumstance is concerned, the same stands proved.", "It is the case of all that Room No. 203 in Meena Guest House was hired by the two accused and the deceased.", "Venki came at about 9.30 p.m., but he left at 10.15 p.m. Thereafter the lodge was locked.", "Therefore, this circumstance is proved.", "Though this circumstance is proved, we must also look into the circumstances under which the accused were last seen together with the deceased.", "The case of the prosecution is that it is the accused who took the deceased to the room with the intention of killing him since the accused Siva suspected that R (PW10) was having an affair with the deceased.", "\nHowever, the manner in which the accused reached Chennai and the guest house in question suggests a total different story.", "The maternal uncle of the deceased (PW1) states that one Jeyaraj, an employee of PW5 informed him over the phone at about 6/7 p.m. on 30.10.2004 that the deceased Arun along with his friend Siddharth was coming to stay in the night with PW1 at Chennai.", "A few minutes later, PW1 talked to his nephew Arun, who also told him that he would be coming to his uncle's house but did not come.", "Siddharth is the son of Gomti Pandian (PW7).", "\nAccording to her, Siddharth told her that he was going to Chennai along with his friend Arun (deceased) to purchase some clothes.", "She was reluctant to send her son with his friend but then she talked to Arun who told her that they would be going to Chennai by bus and convinced her to send Siddharth with him.", "She dropped Siddharth at the bus stand.", "Later she came to know that her son Siddharth had gone to Chennai along with the deceased Arun and three other persons in a car which had met with an accident.", "She was informed about this by Kala Devi (PW8), whose son Mathesh had also travelled in the same car.", "\nThus, it is clear that it was Arun (deceased), who convinced Siddharth's mother to send Siddharth with him.", "This witness also stated that later her son informed her that the car had met with an accident and, thereafter, he and Mathesh did not proceed to Chennai and returned to their homes.", "PW8 states that her son Mathesh had told her that he was going to Coimbatore.", "Next morning she received a call from her brother's son.", "He told her that the car in which Mathesh was travelling had met with an accident.", "\nShe was also told that Mathesh along with his friends Siva, Chandru, Siddharth and Arun came to the house of her brother and thereafter Mathesh returned to home.", "Thus, it is clear that Siddharth and Mathesh were also travelling in the car and they would have also gone to Chennai but for the fact that the car met with an accident.", "Thereafter, Siddharth and Mathesh did not proceed further and returned to their homes.", "As such, it is clear that it was not the accused, who had organised the trip but it was the deceased, who had organised the trip and, therefore, it cannot be said that the accused had taken the deceased to the guest house with the intention of killing him.", "This assumption by both the courts below is based on no evidence.", "\n 2. MEDICAL EVIDENCE", "Medical evidence led in this case clearly indicates that the deceased died due to overdose of Tidijesic.", "It is not disputed that 4 ml of Tidijesic was injected into the wrist of the deceased by Venki, who administered 2 ml of the same substance into himself and thereafter the deceased died.", "\n   The evidence of Dr. R. Baskaran (PW11), who is Professor and Head of the Department of Legal and Forensic Medicines, Royapettai Government Hospital, Chennai clearly shows that after chemical analysis it was found that the amount of the offending substance found in the blood of the deceased would be equal to injecting 40 ml of Tidijesic.", "\nTherefore, there is no manner of doubt that the deceased died due to overdosing of drug.", "\n PW11 stated that if a 20 ml syringe is used then about 40 ml of Tidijesic could be injected in two attempts.", "However, if a 5 ml syringe is used, it would require 810 attempts.", "He clearly states that he cannot tell when and how this 40 ml Tidijesic was injected into the body of the deceased.", "He also could not state what time the death had occurred.", "He also stated that it takes 6 to 24 hours for the drug to take effect and this would further depend upon the quantity of the drug, the physique and the actions of the person injected.", "\nTherefore, his statement does not help us with regard to the time of death or with regard to the number of attempts in which the drug was injected into the body of the deceased.", "\nEven in the postmortem report the approximate time of death has not been indicated.", "Dr. A.N. Shanmugham (PW 6), who conducted the postmortem also could not say when the death took place.", "\n Dr. A.N. Shanmugham (PW6) in his statement had stated that injuries caused by the needle due to injection of medicine were found in fore arm, ankle of front foot, front and middle fore arm.", "He has been confronted with the post mortem report (PD5), in which there is mention of only two injection marks  one in front of left elbow joint and one in middle of left fore arm.", "It is clearly mentioned that no other external or internal injuries seen over the body.", "He has not been able to give a proper explanation why he did not mention other injuries in the postmortem report.", "This would mean that the deceased was injected only twice.", "\n It is the case of the prosecution that on the first occasion the deceased was injected with 4 ml Tidijesic.", "Therefore, 36 ml could not have been injected in one go on the next occasion.", "The police has not recovered any syringe or other material from the room.", "As per the prosecution case, the lodge was locked at about 10.30 p.m..", "The next morning the deceased was found dead.", "No recoveries of any ampoules or syringe have been made from the accused or at their instance to connect them with the offence.", "\n The prosecution, by means of the aforesaid medical evidence, has failed to link the accused with the death of the deceased.", "The prosecution has failed to prove the exact time of death of the deceased.", "The deceased was first injected an injection between 9.30 p.m. to 10.00 p.m..", "As per doctor, the effect of this could end in about six hours.", "\nTherefore, the possibility of the deceased getting up himself in the middle of the night to inject himself cannot be ruled out.", "There is also the possibility of his calling some other person to inject him with the drug.", "Even more importantly, the prosecution has failed to prove where the balance 36 ml of drug came from.", "Who got this drug and when?", "There is no evidence that the accused purchased this drug.", "No recovery has been made from them and, therefore, we are of the view that though it stands proved that the deceased died due to overdose of drug, the prosecution has miserably failed to link the accused with the death of the deceased.", "3. MOTIVE", "The motive put forth is that R (PW10) was close to accused Siva, who introduced her to Arun.", "According to the case set up by the prosecution, the two had developed a close relationship and were regularly chatting with each other on phone and through SMSes.", "This was not liked by Siva (Accused No.1), who thereafter conspired with Chandru (Accused No. 2) to kill the deceased by overdosing him.", "R (PW10) in her statement has not at all supported the prosecution case and according to her, she had never met Arun but had talked to him over phone and that too occasionally.", "She also stated that she and the deceased Arun would exchange SMSes which were usual in nature.", "\n   She, in crossexamination, denied the suggestion that she used to talk to Arun every day.", "She stated that they talked generally about matters relating to college.", "She also denied that she had any special relationship with Siva.", "According to her, Siva was her friend being a collegemate.", "No other evidence has been led to prove that R (PW10) had any special relationship with accused Siva or that she had developed any special relationship with deceased Arun.", "The only evidence in this regard is the statement of R (PW10), which does not support the prosecution case at all.", "\n In this regard, it would also be pertinent to mention that in the first complaint filed by PW1, there is no mention of R (PW10), much less of her having any affair with either the accused or the deceased.", "This was brought out for the first time only in the complaint filed four years after the death of Arun.", "There is no explanation for this long silence of four years.", "Therefore, we are clearly of the view that the motive has not been proved.", "We must also remember that the accused and the deceased were good friends.", "They had studied for many years together and there is not even an iota of evidence about such love triangle.", "\n 4. CHANDRU WAS A MEDICAL STUDENT", "Both the courts below have come to the conclusion that Chandru was asked by Siva to commit the crime because Chandru was a medical student and he alone knew how to inject the substance into the body of the deceased.", "We are constrained to observe that the inference drawn by the courts below was totally ill founded.", "Why would Chandru kill another human being just on the asking of the accused Siva?", "Chandru was a medical student, studying in a profession meant to save lives and not to kill people.", "From the evidence on record it stands established that the deceased was a drug addict and had been taking injectible drugs for a long time.", "It is well known that such drug addicts can easily inject themselves.", "What has happened in this case is not clear but it cannot be said with certainty that Chandru had injected the poisonous substance into the body of the deceased.", "There is no evidence in this regard.", "\nAs we have discussed above, it was not only Siva and Chandru who were coming to Chennai with deceased Arun but Siddharth and Mathesh were also coming to Chennai in the same car.", "However, they went back only after the car met with an accident.", "All these boys were in their late teens or early 20s and two of them got scared after the accident and they went to the homes of their relatives and from there they contacted their respective mothers.", "Since they had obtained permission of their mothers by giving false excuses, they got scared and went back.", "Even as per the prosecution, Chandru had no motive to kill Arun.", "\nTherefore, the inference drawn by the High Court as well as the trial court that Siva and Chandru had conspired or had the common intention of murdering Arun is not based on any cogent or reliable evidence.", "14. Other than the circumstances referred to above, there are other circumstances which go against the prosecution which we shall refer to now: 1. Inconsistency in the statement of PW1  PW1 is the maternal uncle of the deceased.", "In his first complaint made in the police station on 31.10.2004, there is no reference to R (PW10) or other facts which have been stated at a later stage.", "The private complaint filed by him four years later is contrary to the first complaint filed by him immediately after the occurrence.", "His explanation is that he was asked to sign on two blank papers by the police.", "First of all, we see no reason why the police in a case of this nature would try to help the accused and shield the actual criminal.", "Secondly, there is no material on record to show that PW1, the maternal uncle or PW 5, father of the deceased, ever complained to any authority that PW1 had been forced to sign two blank papers.", "This is a case where the maternal uncle and the father of the deceased had approached the High Court on at least two occasions for transfer of the investigation.", "\nThey succeeded once and failed on the second occasion.", "\nIn case the version of PW1 that his signatures were taken on blank papers was correct, then he would have definitely said so much earlier.", "He would have reported the matter to the higher authorities or made mention of this in the petitions filed in the High Court.", "Despite a pointed query to the counsel for the original complainant and the informant and the State they failed to point out whether any such complaint had been made by PW1 or PW5.", "Therefore, we do not accept the version of PW1 that his signatures were obtained on blank sheets of papers.", "This also casts a doubt on the veracity of the statement of PW1.", "2. Delay in filing the private complaint  ", "It is true that PW1 and PW5 were moving the High Court for transfer of the case to some other investigating agency but, at the same time, it would be pertinent to mention that after the chargesheet was filed against Venki by the Investigating Officer (DW4), neither PW1 nor PW5 filed any protest petition to the effect that the accused (appellants herein) should also be arraigned as accused.", "They let the matter go on and it was only after Venki died that the private complaint was filed.", "There is no explanation why no protest petition was filed when the police had only made out a case against accused Venki and that too under Section 304 IPC and not murder.", "3. PW1 and PW5 are not coming to the Court with clean hands  ", "The motive has been introduced after four years.", "The father and the maternal uncle of the deceased never brought up the issue of the deceased having conversations with R (PW10) at any earlier stage.", "\n           Therefore, PW1 and PW5 are not coming to the court with clean hands.", "They have cooked up the story of signing on blank papers and also cooked up the story relating to the motive.", "Therefore, their evidence is not reliable and a person cannot be convicted on the basis of such evidence.", "15. All that is proved is that the deceased and the accused were sleeping in one room and the deceased died due to overdose of drug.", "The prosecution had miserably failed to prove that the accused injected this drug.", "It is the case of the prosecution that the first injection was administered by Venki, which was only 4 ml.", "There is possibility of the deceased injecting himself on the second occasion sometime in the middle of the night or early in the morning.", "In this context, we must remember that the doctor, who conducted the postmortem has not given any approximate time of death of the deceased which could have helped us in the matter.", "The circumstances proved cannot lead to the inference that it is the accused alone who committed the offence.", "In fact, the prosecution has even failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the death is homicidal in view of the inconsistencies in the medical evidence dealt by us above.", "Even otherwise, it is not proved that it was the accused who injected the deceased and the possibility of the accused injecting himself or some other person doing so cannot be ruled out.", "\n 16. In view of the above discussion we allow both the appeals, set aside the judgment dated 30.11.2010 of the High Court in Criminal Appeal No.592 of 2010 and 636 of 2010 and judgment dated 24.09.2010 of the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.V, Chennai in S.C.

Sharma conducted investigation into the case.", "The offence took place at about 9 a.m. on June 9 and though the District Hospital at Farrukaabad was just 10 miles away, the dead body was not received at the hospital for nearly 24 hours after the incident had taken place.", "The excuse offered by the prosecution that cartman was not willing to take the body at night is utterly flimsy because the Investigating officer could have easily made some alternate arrangement for despatchin the dead body for postmortem examination expeditiously.", "With the dead body lying at the scene of offence for nearly 12 hours and thereafter at the police station for another 8 or 9 hours, it was easy enough for the witnesses to mould their statements so as to accord with the nature of injuries.", "The lnvestigating Officer did not make any note at all in the General Diary as to which witnesses were examined by him on the date of the occurrence which was obligatory upon him to do under paragraph 44 of the U.P.

Pandiya who performed the post-mortem examination has described in his evidence the injuries received by Ram Sanehi.", "In all he found 7 injuries on the dead body, out of which injuries 1, 3 and 7, injuries 2 and 4, and injuries 5 and 6 are interconnected.", "Injury No. 1 is described as a \"shot wound\" with its entry above the left nipple.", "Injury No. 3 is described as multiple rounded abrasions on the left side of the chest.", "Injury No. 7 is the wound of exit on the right scapular region, corresponding to injury No. 1.", "rnjury No. 2 consists of 8 gunshot wounds of entry below the right nipple while injury No. 4 consists of multiple rounded abrasions above the right nipple.", "Injury No. 5 is a gun-shot wound of entry on the back of the left forearm while injury No. 6 is the corresponding wound of exit near the ulnar aspect of the left forearm.", "\n The evidence of Dr. Pandiya and the description of the injuries given by him in the post-mortem report tend to show that two different kinds of firearms were used by the assailants of Ram Sanehi.", "Injury No. 1 was caused by a bullet and that is clear not only from the description of the injury but from what Dr. Pandiya has stated in his evidence.", "He says: \"The bullet, which had entered through injury No. 1 went out straight after emerging from injury No. 7\".", "Injuries Nos. 2 and 5 were caused by pellets.", "This shows that whereas injury No. 1 was caused by a firearm in the nature of a rifle, injuries 2 and 5 were caused by an ordinary gun.", "The medical evidence thus falsifies the eye- witnesses' account according to which, the appellant Subhash alone was armed with a double-barrelled gun, the other appellant Shyam Narain being armed with a lathi.", "The objective inference arising from the nature of injuries received by the deceased has a significant impact on the case of the prosecution, which has been overlooked by both the Sessions Court and the High Court.", "\n While we are on the medical evidence it would be appropriate to mention that there was no tatooing or charring on any of the firearm injuries which, according to the doctor, shows that the firing was done from a distance of more than 4 feet.", "In the First Information Report Bal Kishore has stated that as soon as he, his father and sister, reached the culvert, Subhash \"touching the chest\" of Ram Sanehi \"with thebarrel of his gun\" said that he shall not leave him alive; Shyam Narain thereupon exhorted Subhash not to delay and fire immediately; Subhash then fired three shots in quick succession, one of which mishred.", "The trend of the F.I.R. is that Subhash fired the first two shots at Ram Sanehi from a point blank range, in which event indisputably, there would have been tatooing and charring around the injuries.", "Bal Kishore has attempted to offer an explanation that what he meant to say in his compaint was that Subhash trained his gun \"towards\" Ram Sanehi's chest and not \"on\" his chest.", "\nThis explanation is an after thought and in the circumstances difficult to accept.", "Thus in another important respect, the medical evidence falsifies the case of the prose cution.", "\n There is another aspect of the medical evidence which, though, not as important as the two aspects mentioned above, may also be referred to.", "The case of the prosecution is that Ram Sanehi had gone to his Kharbuza field with his son and daughter for eating Kharobuzsas.", "There is evidence that they did eat Kharbuzas and almost immediately there after they started back for home.", "Within less than 5 minutes, Ram Sanehi met with his deat near the culvert.", "The post-mortem report shows that Ram Sanehi's stomach was empty which means that the evidence that he had eaten Kharbuzas just a little time before his death is untrue.", "Bal Kishore tried to wriggle out of this situation by saying that Ram Sanehi had eaten just a small slice of Kharbuza.", "But even there, Dr.\nPandiya has stated that if the entire slice of Kharbuza was eaten by Ram Sanehi, its remains would be found in the stomach provided there was no vomiting after the gun-shot injuries.", "Since Ram Sanehi had not vomited, his large intestines could not have been found to be empty if the story of his children was true.", "\n This last circumstance may at first sight seem trivial but its importance consists in the fact that the visit of Ram Sanehi, along with his children, to the Kharbuza field for the purpose of eating Kharbuzas is the very genesis of the incident which happened on June 9, 1972.", "Coupled with the circumstance that the Investigating officer did not even pay a visit to the Kharbuza field, leave alone making a Panchnama thereof, the conclusion is irresistible that the story that the children had accompanied their father to the Kharbuza field lacks a factual basis.", "The other circumstances which render the prosecution case suspect are these (1) Ram Sanehi is alleged to have been drageed over 6 or 7 paces by the appellants but not even an abrasion was found on his back or stomach which could be attributed to dragging.", "(2) Thirty or forty persons are alleged to have collected at the sence of occurrence but Bal Kishore was not able to mention the name of even one of them and it is common ground that the Investigating officer did not record the statement of any of them.", "(3) Jhabboo Singh, Shyam Lal Brij Bhushan and Mangali Prasad reached the scene of offence even before the appellants had fled away but none from amongst the first three was examined by the prosecution.", "Mangali Prasad was examined as an eye-witness but he has been concurrently disbelieved by the Sessions Court and the High Court.", "(4) Though the motive of the offence is alleged to be that in a complaint filed by Pooran Lal against the appellant Subhash, the deceased Ram Sanehi was cited as a witness, Mangali Prasad's evidence shows that immediately after the firing, Bal Kishore told him that Ram Sanehi was murdered because of the disputes concerning the election to the Pradhanki.", "What Bal Kishore told Mangali Prasad immediately after the incident seems more probable because, one Virendrapal had contested that election and the appellant Subhash had defeated him.", "When Bal Kishore went to lodge his F.I.R. at the police station he was accompanied by Virendrapal, though an attempt was made to show that Virendrapal was only standing outside the police station and had met-Bal Kishore accidently.", "(5) The story of Bal Kishore that after the appellant Subhash fired 2 shots he re-loaded his gun but the re-loaded cartridge misured makes hardly any sense.", "Subhash was armed with a double barrelled gun and having fired 2 fatal shots from a close range at his target, it is unlikely that he would re-load the gun and that too with only one cartridge.", "And if that cartridge misfired, it is impossible to understand how it could be found concealed in the folds of Ram Sanehi's dhoti.", "\n There is only one other aspect of the matter which remains to be considered and since the High Court has placed great reliance thereon, it is necessary to deal with it.", "The F.I.R. which lodged at about 12 O'clock at noon on the 9th itself mentions that after Ram Sanehi was murdered, the appellant Subhash told his companion Shyam Narain that he himself was going to surrender before a court and that Shyam Narain should make his own arrangement.", "In fact, Subhash did surrender in the court of the Additional District Magistrate, Farrukhabad, at about 4 p.m. on the 9th.", "What the High Court has over-looked is that Subhash did not surrender in connection with the murder of Ram Sanehi but he surrendered along with the 13 or 14 other accused against whom Pooran Lal had filed a complaint.", "In so far as Shyam Narain is concerned, the High Court is wrong in saying that he managed somehow to get himself arrested.", "The evidence of Constable Virendra Singh shows that Shyam Narain was arrested because he was crossing the railway lines and if he was not caught, he would have been run over by the two trains coming from Kanpur and Farrukhabad.", "This was hardly any sensible way of making an \"arrangement\" for himself, as directed by Subhash.", "It is therefore not as if the statement attributed to Subhash in the F.I.R. is corroborated by subsequent events so as to afford a guarantee to Bal Kishore's presence at the culvert.", "\n We are conscious that the Sessions Court and the High Court have both held that the appellants committed the murder of Ram Sanehi but the weight of the circumstances which we have discussed above is so preponderating that even the concurrent finding cannot be allowed to stand.", "In any event, it seems to us impossible to hold that the prosecution has established its case beyond a reasonable doubt.", "\n We therefore allow this appeal, set aside the order of conviction and sentence recorded by the High Court and the Sessions Court and direct that the appellants shall be set at liberty.\n M.R.

Planters Nut and Chocolate Company Limited(2) where the Court observed as follows: \"The words \"fruit\" and \"vegetable\" are not defined in the Act and so far as 'I am aware they are not defined in any other Act in pari material.", "They are ordinary words in every-day use and are therefore to be con- strued according to their popular sense\".\n       ", "In these circumstances, therefore, we have to construe the expression \"sanitary fittings\" in the popular sense of the term as it is used in our every-day life.", "Thus constru- ing, it would be manifest that there could be no question of use of R.C.C. or hume pipes which are generally laid underground and are extremely heavy.", "for the purpose of use in lavatories, urinals or bath-rooms etc.", "By \"sanitary fittings\" we only understand such pipes or materials as are used in lavatories, urinals or bath-rooms of private houses or public buildings.", "Even where a hume pipe is used for carrying, the secreted material from the commode to the septic tank that may be treated as sanitary fittings.", "In the instant case as there was. absolutely no material before the Sales Tax Officer to show that any of the hume pipes manufactured and sold by the respondent were meant for use in lavatories, urinals or bath-rooms and in fact the materi- al was used entirely the other way, the Sales Tax Officer was not at all justified in holding that they were sanitary fittings.", "\n       (1) [1962] 1 S.C.R. 279, 282.\n       (2) (1951) Canada L.R. Ex. Court 122", "126Of course, we must make it clear that if at any time the material produced before the Sales Tax authorities estab- lishes that in a given case the hume pipes were meant for use in a bathroom, lavatory, urinal etc.. then the. notifi- cation of the Government would attracted and the assessee must be liable to be taxed at the rate of 7%.", "\n       Lastly, it was feebly argued by Mr. Manchanda that the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition and should have allowed the assessee to avail of the reme- dies provided to him under the U.P. Sales. Tax Act, particu- larly when questions of fact had to be determined.", "In the instant case, the question as to what is the true connota- tion of the words \"sanitary fittings\" and whether the hume pipes manufactured and sold by the respondent were sanitary fittings within the meaning of that expression was a ques- tion of law and since the entire material on the basis of which this question could be determined was placed before the Sales Tax Officer and it pointed in one and only one direction, namely, that the hume pipes were not sanitary fittings and there Was nothing to show otherwise, the High Court was justified in entertaining the writ petition.", "\nMoreover, there is no rule of law that the High Court should not entertain.", "a writ petition where an alternative remedy is available to a party.", "It is always a matter of discretion with the Court and if the discretion has been exercised by the High Court not unreasonably, or perversely, it is the settled practice of this Court not to interfere with the exercise of discretion by the nigh Court.", "The High Court in the present case entertained the writ petition and decid- ed the question of law arising in it and in our opinion rightly.", "In these circumstances, therefore, we would not be justified in the interest of justice in interfering in our jurisdiction under Art. 136 of the Constitution to quash the order of the High Court merely on this ground after having found that the order is legally correct.", "We are, therefore, unable to accept this contention.", "For these reasons.", "therefore, we find ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court and affirm the same.", "The result is that the appeal fails and is accordingly dismissed with costs.", "\n

K. Patel.", "In June 1952, an application for adjudicating the two appellants insolvents was filed in the Insolvency Court at Ahmedabad.", "An insolvency notice was also taken out against the two appellants at the instance of another creditor in the High Court at Bombay.", "Proceedings for winding up the company were commenced in the High Court at Bombay.", "In the meantime, the mortgagee of the machinery and factory of the company had entered into possession under a covenant reserved in that behalf, of the premises of the factory of the company.", "The Textile Commissioner made attempts to recover the cloth remaining undelivered by the company.", "A letter was posted by the Textile Commissioner on April 16, 1952, calling upon the company to deliver 51,756 yards of cloth lying with it in bleached condition to the Chief Ordnance Officer, Ordnance Depot,, Sewri, but the letter was returned undelivered.", "It was ultimately served with the help of the police on the second appellant in October 1952.", "Thereafter on November 7, 1952, another letter was addressed to the company and the same was served on the second appellant on November 25, 1952.", "By this letter, the company was reminded that 1,35,726-3/4 yards of clothwere lying with it on account of the government and the same had to be accounted for, and that the instructions to deliver 51,756 yards to the Chief Ordnance Officer, Ordnance Depot, Sewri, had not been attended to.", "The Textile Commissioner called upon the company to send its representatives to \" clarify the position \" and to account for the material.", "After receiving this letter, the second appellant attended at the office of the' Textile Commissioner and on November 27, 1952, wrote a letter stating that \" the main factors involved in not delivering the goods in finished state was that the material was very old \", was \" dhobibleached in different lots\", was \"\nbleached under different conditions and therefore unsuitable for vat colour dyeing in heavy shades\", that it varied in length, weight, and finish and had \" lost affinity for vat colour dyeing\".", "It was also stated that the company had in dyeing the basic material, suffered \" huge losses\" estimated at Rs. 40,000.", "It was then stated: \" We are, therefore, however prepared to co-operate with the Government and are willing to make good the government's bare cost.", "Please let us know the detail and the actual amount to be deposited so that we may do so at, an early date.", "We shall thank you if we are given an appointment to discuss the matter as regards the final amount with respect to the balance quantity of the basic material.\"", "On December 29, 1952, the premises of the company and the place of residence of the appellants were raided, but no trace of the cloth was found.", "A complaint was then filed with the police charging the two appellants with criminal breach of trust.", "in respect of 1,32,4041 yards of cloth belonging to the Government.", "\nThere is no dispute that approximately 1,30,000 yards out of the cloth -entrusted to the company by the Textile Commissioner for dyeing has not been returned.", "By its letter dated December 4, 1950, the company admitted liability to deliver 1,29,748 yards of cloth, but this cloth has not been returned to the Textile Commissioner in spite of repeated demands.", "That the appellants, as directors of the company had dominion over that cloth was not questioned in, the trial court.", "The plea that there were other Directorsof the company besides the appellants who had dominion over the cloth has been negatived by the High Court and in our judgment rightly.", "Direct evidence to establish misappropriation of the cloth over which the appellants had dominion is undoubtedly lacking, but to establish a charge of criminal breach of trust, the prosecution is not obliged to prove the precise mode of conversion, misappropriation or misapplication by the accused of the property entrusted to him or over which he has dominion.", "The principal ingredient of the offence being dishonest misappropriation or conversion which may not ordinarily be a matter of direct proof, entrustment of property and failure in breach of an obligation to account for the property entrusted, if proved, may in the light of other circumstances, justifiably lead to -an inference of dishonest misappropriation or conversion.", "\nConviction of a person for the offence of criminal breach of trust may not, in all cases, be founded merely on his failure to account for the property entrusted to him, or over which he has dominion, even when a duty to account is imposed upon him, but where he is unable to account or renders an explanation for his failure to account which is untrue, an inference of misappropriation with dishonest intent may readily be made.", "\nIn this case, on a search of the factory on December 29, 1952, the cloth remaining to be delivered by the company was not found.", "At the trial, the appellants sought to explain the disappearance of the cloth from the factory premises where it was stored, on the plea that it was old and was eaten up by white-ants and moths, and had been thrown away as rubbish.", "This plea of the appellants was not accepted by the High Court and we think rightly.", "No information was given at any time to the Textile Commissioner after December 4, 1950, that the cloth had been eaten up by white-ants and moths, and was therefore thrown away or otherwise destroyed.", "\nNor was any evidence led in support of the plea by the appellants.", "\nIn this court, counsel for the first appellant contended that failure to return the cloth may give rise to a civil liability to make good the loss occasionedthereby, but in the circumstances of the case, the first appellant cannot be found guilty of the offence of criminal breach of trust.", "Counsel submitted that the first appellant had left Bombay in 1950 and had settled down in Ahmedabad and was attending to a factory in that town, that thereafter the first appellant was involved in insolvency proceedings and was unable to attend to the affairs of the company in Bombay, and if, on account of the pre-occupation of the first appellant at Ahmedabad, he was unable to visit Bombay and the goods were lost, no criminal misappropriation can be attributed to him.", "But the case pleaded by the appellant negatives this submission.", "The first appellant in his statement before the trial court admitted that he often went to Bombay even after he had migrated to Ahmedabad and-that he visited the mill premises and got the same opened by the Gurkha watchman and he found that the heap of cloth lying in the mill was getting smaller every time he visited the mill and on inquiry, he was told by the watchman that every day one basketful of sweepings was thrown away.", "He also stated that he was shown several places in the compound of the factory where pits had been filled up with these sweepings, and that he found a small heap lying by the side of the \"\nTulsipipe gutter\" and also in the warehouses in the mill premises.", "It is clear from this statement and other evidence on the record that even after he migrated to Ahmedabad, the first appellant was frequently visiting the factory at Bombay.", "The evidence also discloses that meetings of Directors were held from time to time, but the minutes of the Directors' meetings have not been produced.", "\nThe books of account-of the company evidencing disbursements to the Directors of remuneration for attending the meetings and the expenses for the alleged collection and throwing away of the sweepings have not been produced.", "It is admitted by the first appellant that the letter dated November 27, 1952, was written by the second appellant under his instructions.", "In his statement at the trial, the first appellant stated that he was informed of the letter dated November 26, 1952, from the Textile Commissioner and that he326 could not attend the office of that officer because he was busy attending to the insolvency proceedings and that he deputed the second appellant to attend the office and to explain and discuss the position.", "Be then stated, \"We had informed the Commissioner that the company was prepared to pay for the cloth remaining after deducting the amount claimed as damages\".", "The letter dated November 27, 1952, was evidently written under the direction of the first appellant and by that letter, liability to pay for the cloth after certain adjustments for losses alleged to be suffered by the company in carrying out the contract was admitted.\n", "By the letter dated December 4, 1950, liability to deliver the cloth was admitted and by the letter dated November 27, 1952, liability to pay compensation for the loss occasioned to the Government was affirmed.", "The appellants who were liable to account for the cloth over which they had dominion have failed to do so, and they have rendered a false explanation for their failure to account.", "The High Court was of the opinion that this false defence viewed in the light of failure to produce the books of account, the stock register and the complete absence of reference in the correspondence with the Textile Commissioner about the cause of disappearance established misappropriation with criminal intent.", "\n Counsel for the first appellant contended that probably the goods passed into the possession of the mortgagees of the assets of the company.", "but on this part of the submission, no evidence was led in the trial court.", "Counsel for the first appellant, relying upon the observations in Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. The State of Bombay (1), also contended that, in any event, a charge under s. 409 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code cannot be established against the first appellant unless it is shown that at the time of misappropriation of the goods, the first appellant was physically present .", "But the essence of liability under s.34 is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the offenders leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of the (1) [1955] 1 S.C R. 1177.common intention and presence of the offender sought to be rendered liable under s. 34 is not, on the words of the statute, one of the conditions of its applicability.", "As explained by Lord Sumner in Barendra Kumar Ghose v. The King Emperor(') the leading feature of s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code is 'participation' in action.", "To establish joint responsibility for an offence, it must of course be established that a criminal act was done by several persons; the participation must be in doing the act, not merely in its planning.", "A common intention--a meeting of minds--to commit an offence and participation in the commission of the offence in furtherance of that common intention invite the application of s. 34.", "But this participation need not in all cases be by physical presence.", "In offences involving physical violence, normally presence at the scene of offence of the offenders sought to be rendered liable on the principle of joint liability may be necessary, but such is not the case in respect of other offences where the offence consists of diverse acts which may be done at different times and places.", "In Shree Kantiah's case (supra), misappropriation was committed by removing goods from a Government depot and on the occasion of the removal of the goods, the first accused was not present.", "It was therefore doubtful whether he had participated in the commission of the offence, and this court in those circumstances held that participation by the first accused was not established.", "The observations in Shree Kantiah's case (supra) in so far as they deal with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code must, in our judgment, be read in the light of the facts established and are not intended to lay down a principle of universal application.", "\nThe High Court has found that the two appellants were liable to account for the cloth over which they had dominion and.\nthey failed to account for the same and therefore each had committed the offence of criminal breach of trust.", "The High Court observed: \" In such a case, if accused Nos. 1 and 2 (Appellants 1 & 2) alone were concerned with the receipt of the goods, if they were dealing with the goods all the time, if they were receiving communications from the Textile Commissioner's office and sending replies, to (1) [1924] L.R. 52 I.A. 40, 52.them, and if the part played by each of them is apparent from the manner in which they are shown to have dealt with this contract, then it is a case of two persons entrusted with the goods and a breach of trust obviously being committed by both of them'.\n", "It was submitted that the High Court erred in finding the appellants guilty of offences under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code when the charge framed against them was one under s. 409 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code.", "A charge framed against the accused person, referring to s. 34 is but a convenient form of giving notice to him that the principle of joint liability is sought to be invoked.", "Section 34 does not create an offence; it merely enunciates a principle of joint liability for criminal acts done in furtherance of the common intention of the offenders.", "Conviction of an accused person recorded, relying upon the principle of joint liability, is therefore for the offence committed in furtherance of the common intention and if the reasons for conviction establish that the accused was convicted for an offence committed in furtherance of the common intention of himself and others, a reference in the order recording conviction to s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code may appear to be asurplusage.", "The order of the High Court recording the conviction of the appellants for the offence under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code is therefore not illegal.", "\nIt was submitted for the first appellant that the sentence passed against him was unduly severe, and that, in any event, no distinction should have been made between him and the second appellant in the matter of sentence.", "It is evident on the findings accepted by us that property of considerable value has been misappropriated by the first appellant.", "He was the Managing Director of the company an& primarily, he had dominion over the property entrusted to the company.", "The second appellant was, though a Director, essentially a technician.", "Having regard to these circumstances, if the High Court has made a distinction between the two appellants, we ought not to interfere with the sentence, which by itself cannot be said to be excessive.", "\nThe appeal fails and is dismissed.", "\n Appeal dismissed."]}, {"labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 9, 9, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 10, 10, 10, 11, 12], "segments": ["PETITIONER:\nIYANAHALLI BAKKAPPA & SONS.\n\nVs.\n\nRESPONDENT:\nSTATE OF MYSORE\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT29/10/1971", "BENCH:\nREDDY, P.

It is in this background that the Court below after having found that though it could not be denied that PW-1 had suffered serious injuries, the evidence in support of the alleged charges against the accused was the evidence of PWs-1, 4, 5 and 9.", "It was found that PW-1 categorically denied the presence of accused No.3 and consequently he had stated in his evidence that accused No.1 assaulted him with an axe and accused No.2 assaulted him with a sword but contrary to this PWs-4 and 5 had deposed that accused No.1 assaulted Sharanappa with an axe and accused No.2 assaulted him with a sword.", "Further, PW-1 in his evidence had stated that he was alone on the land but contrary to this PWs-4 and 5 had deposed that they were also present on the land at the time of the incident and that when they tried to intervene, to rescue Sharanappa, the accused No.1 threatened them and pushed them away.", "Therefore, the Court below has seriously doubted the very presence of PW-4 and PW-5 in view of the contradictory statements and coming from the mouth of PW-1 the injured witness.", "The Court below has also contemplated that if really PWs-4 and 5 were also present on the land and tried to rescue Sharanappa from the accused who were armed with a sword and an axe as alleged, it is difficult to understand as to how they had not sustained any injuries.", "6. Further it was also in the evidence of PWs-4 and 5 that they carried Sharanappa to hospital in a jeep and that he was heavily bleeding and their clothes were also blood stained but interestingly the Investigating Officer had not thought it fit to seize those blood stained clothes.", "Further, PW-1 in his evidence has stated that at the time of incident there were 20 labourers engaged in harvesting the sugar cane crop.", "However, the Investigating Officer had not made any attempt to record the statement of those witnesses who were the best witnesses to speak about the incident, as they would have been totally independent witnesses.", "That if really such an offence had been committed, as alleged in the complaint and as stated by PWs-4 and 5, the labourers who were working in the field would have witnessed the incident.", "Therefore, in the absence of any such independent evidence on record, the testimony of the said witnesses has been characterized as being tutored and interested testimony, especially, when there are material contradictions as regards the weapons seized and the manner in which the same have stated to have been employed by the accused in assaulting the injured and which is contradictorily stated by the said witnesses.", "7. Further, PWs-4 and 5 had deposed that immediately after the incident they carried Sharanappa first to the police station and thereafter to the hospital.", "But the evidence of the Investigating Officer discloses that after he was informed of the incident he had come to the hospital and recorded the statement of the complainant.", "\nThis is yet another contradiction which has been disbelieved by the Court as to the manner in which the incident may have occurred.", "\nApart from these witnesses, there were other witnesses such as PW- 9 who was a circumstantial witness of the incident and the evidence of that witness was also of no help to the prosecution.", "8. Similarly, PW-6 who was the father of PW-1 had deposed that he was in his house at the time of the incident and when he visited the land, PW-1 had already been carried to the hospital for treatment and in this manner the Court below has discarded the evidence of this witness, apart from PWs-10, 12 and 14 who were all formal witnesses in respect of the panchanama and spot mahazar etc.", "In fact PWs-12 and 14 who are the panch witnesses and seizure mahazar, have not supported the prosecution case and they were treated as hostile witnesses.", "9. Further, the Court below has discussed the evidence of PW- 3, the Medical practitioner of the Government Hospital, Aland, who had stated that Sharanappa was brought by one Nagappa for treatment and that he had been assaulted with an axe and a knife and the doctor has spoken about the serious injuries which were identified as seven in number and that the patient was shifted to a larger hospital as the injuries were very grievous in nature.", "Though the medical evidence clearly indicated that the victim had suffered grievous injuries, the evidence of the other witnesses was not consistent in the manner as to how those injuries were caused.", "10. PW-1 deposed that there was a property dispute between his father and father of accused No.1.", "He has narrated that accused No.1 assaulted him with an axe on his right palm, as a result of which the thumb got severed and accused No.2 assaulted him with an axe on his right palm and also on the wrist of his left hand and accused No.1 repeated his assault with the axe on the left portion of his chest, thereafter he had lost consciousness.", "He had further stated that when accused Nos.1 and 2 had attacked him, there was none present on the land and that at the time of the incident accused No.3 was carrying water to her house.", "However, in his cross- examination he had denied that accused No.3 was present at all.", "\nOn which he was treated as a hostile witness and the prosecution has cross-examined him on that aspect.", "\n 11. PW-5 who is the son of PW-1 had stated that accused No.1 had assaulted PW-1 on his right palm with the sword as a result of which the thumb was severed and he and PW-4 intervened.\nAccused No.2 had threatened him with the axe thereafter accused No.2 continued to assault his father with an axe on the left hand causing injuries.", "Accused No.2 also caused injury on the left shoulder and thereafter he had lost consciousness.", "That accused No.3 was all along exhorting accused Nos.1 and 2 to murder Sharanappa.", "\n 12. Given these inconsistencies in the case of the prosecution, though it cannot be denied that PW-1 had suffered serious injuries, since the manner in which the incident had unfolded and the participation of the accused, as alleged, being inconsistently narrated by the witnesses, the trial Court has rightly felt that it was not possible to reconcile the inconsistencies and contradictions and therefore has held that prosecution has failed to bring home the charges beyond all reasonable doubt as against the accused and has acquitted them.", "Though the learned Additional Advocate General would make an effort to salvage the case, as could be seen from the evidence tendered, it is full of inconsistencies which cannot be reconciled and the trial Court has rightly acquitted the accused on the grounds as stated.", "\n 13.

To prove its case, prosecution has examined only three witnesses.", "Out of whom P.W. 2 is the SI of Excise Sadar Mobile in charge of Ujalpur and P.W. 1 is the accompanying Excise constable.", "Pw 3 is the cited independent seizure witness to the alleged occurrence.", "Prosecution proved certain documents marked as Ext. 1 & Ext. 2.", "On the other hand, no oral or documentary evidence adduced on behalf of accused person in his defence.", "\n 6.

(3) of Article 20 of the Constitution ?", "But Mr.\nChaudhry, appearing for the appellant, does not press this question now before us.", "The first contention canvassed by the Counsel is that on the facts and circumstances of the case, the appellant's statement recorded under s. 108 of the Customs Act 1962, on the foot of which the appellant has been convicted, was hit by clause (3) of Article 20 because at the time of making that statement, the appellant was \"accused of any offence\"\nunder s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act, and the statement was obtained under compulsion of law.", "Stress has been placed on the fact that the appellant was, in fact, arrested by the police on a charge under s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act and the goods were seized under a Panchnama, prepared by them in the course of investigation.", "In this connection, reference has been made toM. P. Sharma and Ors. v. Satish Chandra, District Magistrate, Delhi and", "Ors.(1)", "On the other hand, Mr. H. R. Khanna, appearing for the respondent submits that the words \"accused of any offence\"\noccurring in Art. 20(3) take in only that person against whom a formal accusation of an offence has been levelled.", "\nTwo other conditions for the applicability of this Clause, according to the Counsel, are: (a) that the testimony in question had been obtained under compulsion, and (b) it relates to the offence of which he stands formally accused.", "\nThese conditions, it is maintained, were not fulfilled in the present case.", "\n Clause (3) of Article 20 provides: \"No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself\".", "\n         From an analysis of this clause, it is apparent that in order to claim the benefit of the guarantee against testimonial compulsion embodied in this clause, it must be shown, firstly, that the person who made the statement was \"accused of any offence\" secondly, that he made this statement under compulsion.", "The phrase \"accused of any offence\" has been the subject of several decisions of this Court so that by now it is well settled that only a person against whom a formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence has been levelled which in the normal course may result in his prosecution, would fall within its ambit.", "In R. C. Mehta v. State of West Bengal, this point came up for consideration in the context of a statement recorded by an officer of Customs in an enquiry under s. 171-A of the Sea Customs Act.", "One of the contentions raised was, that a person against whom such an enquiry is made is a `person accused of an offence', and on that account, he cannot be compelled to be a witness against himself and the statement obtained or evidence collected under the aforesaid provision by the officer of Customs is inadmissible.", "This contention was repelled.", "Shah J., speaking for the Court, made these apposite observations: \"Under s. 171-A of the Sea Customs Act, a Customs officer has power in an enquiry in connection with the smuggling of goods to summon any person whose attendance he considers necessary, to give evidence or to produce a document or any other thing, and by cl.\n         (3) the person so summoned is bound to state the truth upon any subject respecting which he is examined or makes statements and to produce such documents and other things as may be required.", "The expression \"any person\" includes a person who is suspected or believed to be concerned in the smuggling of goods.", "But a person arrested by a Customs officer because he is found in possession of smuggled goods or on suspicion that he is concerned in smuggling is not when called upon by the Customs officer to make a statement or to produce a document or thing, a person accused of an         offence within the meaning of Art. 20(3) of the Constitution.", "The steps taken by the Customs officer are for the purpose of holding an enquiry under the Sea Customs Act and for adjudging confiscation of goods dutiable or prohibited and imposing penalties.", "The Customs officer does not at that stage accuse the person suspected of infringing the provisions of the Sea Customs Act with the commission of any offence.", "His primary duty is to prevent smuggling and to recover duties of customs when collecting evidence in respect of smuggling against a person suspected of infringing the provisions of the Sea Customs Act he is not accusing the person of any offence punishable at a trial before a magistrate\".", "\n         After a survey of case law, the Court pointed out the circumstances, the existence of which is ordinarily necessary to clothe a person with the character of a \"person accused of an offence\": \"Normally a person stands in the character of an accused when a First Information Report is lodged.\n         against him in respect of an offence before an officer competent to investigate it, or when a complaint is made relating to the commission of an offence before a Magistrate competent to try or send to another Magistrate for trial the offence.", "Where a Customs officer arrests a person and informs that person of the grounds of his arrest (which he is bound to do under Art. 221) of the Constitution for the purpose of holding an enquiry into the infringement of the provisions of the Sea Customs Act which he has reason to believe has taken place, there is no formal accusation of an offence.", "In the case of an offence by infringement of the Sea Customs Act and punishable at the trial before a Magistrate, there is an accusation when a complaint is lodged by an officer competent in that behalf before the Magistrate\".\n         ", "The above-quoted observations are a complete answer to the contention of the appellant.", "In the light of these principles, it is clear that when the statement of the appellant was recorded by the Customs officer under s. 108, the appellant was not a person \"accused of any offence\"\nunder the Customs Act, 1962.", "An accusation which would stamp him with the character of such a person was, levelled only when the complaint was filed against him, by the Assistant Collector of Customs complaining of the commission of offences under s. 135(a) and s. 135(b) of the Customs Act.", "\n         True, that the appellant was arrested by the police on December 12, 1967 on suspicion of having committed an offence under s. 124, of the Bombay Police Act and a Panchnama of the packages in the truck was also prepared.", "\nBut the factual ingredients of that offence are materially different from those of an offence under the Customs Act.", "\n This will be apparent from a bare reading of s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act, which provides : \"Whoever has in his possession or conveys in any manner, or offers for sale or pawn, anything which there is         reason to believe is stolen property or property fraudulently obtained shall, if he fails to account for such possession or to act to the satisfaction of the Magistrate, on conviction, be punished with imprisonment for a term (which may extend to one year but shall not, except for reasons to be recorded in writing, be less taken one month and shall also be liable to the fine which may extend to five hundred rupees).\n         Even in respect of that offence, the police did not register any case or enter any F.I.R. which normally furnishes a foundation for commencing a police investigation.", "The police did not open the packages or prepare inventories of the goods packed therein.", "Indeed, the police appear to have dropped further proceedings.", "They did not take any steps for prosecuting the appellant even for an offence under the Bombay Police Act, 1951.", "They informed the customs authorities, who opened the packages, inspected the goods and on finding them contraband goods, seized them under a Panchnama.", "The Customs authorities called the appellant and his companion to the Customs House, took them into custody, and after due compliance with the requirements of law, the Inspector of Customs questioned the appellant and recorded his statement under s. 108 of the Customs Act.", "\nUnder the circumstances it was manifest that at the time when the Custom officer recorded the statement of the appellant, the latter was not formally \"accused of any offence.\"", "The High Court was therefore right in holding that the statement recorded by the Inspector of Customs was not hit by Article 20(3) of the Constitution.", "The next question to be considered is, whether this statement was hit by s. 24 of the Evidence Act.", "The contention is that this statement was obtained under compulsion of law inasmuch as he was required to state the truth under threat of prosecution for perjury.", "\n         For reasons that follow, we are unable to sustain this contention.", "\n         To attract the prohibition enacted in s. 24, Evidence Act, these facts must be established: (i) that the statement in question is a confession; (ii) that such confession has been made by an accused person; (iii)that it has been made to a person in authority; (iv) that the confession has been obtained by reason of any inducement, threat or promise proceeding from a person in authority; (v) such inducement, threat or promise, must have reference to the charge against the accused person; (vi) the inducement, threat or promise must in the opinion of the Court be sufficient to give the accused person grounds, which would appear to him reasonable, for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.", "\n         In the present case, facts (i), (iv) and (vi) have not been established.", "Firstly, the statement in question is not a \"confession' within the contemplation of s. 24.", "It is now well-settled that a statement in order to amount to a \"confession\" must either admit in terms the offence, or at any rate substantially all the facts which constitute the offence.", "An admission of an incriminating fact, howsoever grave, is not by itself a confession.", "A statement which contains an exculpatory assertion of some fact, which if true, would negative the offence alleged, cannot amount to a confession (see Pakala Narayana v. R.; Plavinder Kaur v.\nState of Punjab; Om Prakash v. State.\n         ", "A perusal of the statement Ex. I made by the appellant before the Inspector of Customs would show that it contained exculpatory matter.", "Therein, the deponent claimed that he was not aware that the packages which were loaded in the truck were contraband goods, and alleged that the goods were not loaded under his instructions.", "The deponent claimed to be an innocent traveller in the truck when he said: \"I did not ask Mullaji (driver) what goods were being loaded in his lorry...", "Mullaji was only my friend and I was not aware of any of his mala fide activities\".", "\n         Moreover, the incriminating facts admitted in this statement, do not, even if taken cumulatively amount to admission of all the facts which constitute any offence.", "To bring home an offence under s. 135 of the Customs Act, in addition to the facts admitted in Ex. I, it had to be established further that these goods were contraband goods.", "\n         For these reasons, it could be said beyond doubt, that the statement Ex. 1 was not a \"confession\" within the meaning of s. 24, Evidence Act.", "\n         Secondly, it has not been shown that the Customs officer-though a person in authority-had offered any inducement or held out any threat or promise to the appellant.", "\n         Christopher Soares, the Inspector of (Customs (P. W. 4) testified that no threats, coercion or inducements were used and that the statement Ex. 1 was made by the appellant, voluntarily.\n         ", "While it may be conceded that a person summoned by an officer of Customs to make a statement under s. 108 of the Customs Act, is under compulsion of law to state the truth, the compulsion there under, assuming it amounts to a threat, does not proceed \"from a person in authority\" within the contemplation of s. 24, but emanates from law.", "\n         Thirdly, the mere fact that the Inspector of Customs had, before recording the statement, warned the deponent of the possibility of hisprosecution for perjury in case he did not make the statement truthfully, cannot be construed as a threat held out by the officer which could have reasonably caused the person making the statement to suppose that he would by making that statement, gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him for smuggling.\n         ", "In view of what has been said above, we have no hesitation in holding that the statement Ex. 1, was not barred under s. 24, Evidence Act.", "The statement Ex. P-1 was clearly admissible under s. 21, Evidence Act as an admission of incriminating facts.", "\n         Lastly, Mr. Chaudhry tried to contend that the incriminating facts admitted in Ex. 1 taken along with the other facts appearing in the evidence of prosecution witnesses, were insufficient to establish an offence under s. 135, Customs Act against the appellant because no notification under sub-s. (2) of s. 123, of the Customs Act had been issued in respect of the import of the goods of the kind seized, and the aid of the statutory presumption under that section was not available to the prosecution.\n ", "We are unable to accept this contention.", "While it is true that in the absence of the requisite notification, the statutory presumption under s. 123 could not be invoked by the prosecution, the circumstances established unerringly raise an inference with regard to all the factual ingredients of an offence under s. 135(b) read with s.\n 135(ii) of the Customs Act.", "In Ex. 1 which was proved by P.W. 4, it is admitted that these packages which were later found to contain contraband goods by the Customs authorities, were surreptitiously loaded in the truck under cover of darkness at Reti Bunder (sea shore) from the side of sea-side wall, in the presence of the appellant, and thereafter the first accused took the wheel, while the appellant sat by his side in the truck, and drove towards Sandhurst Station.", "It is further admitted that some Bania paid Rs. 2,000/- to the appellant which was meant to be given to the driver of the truck.", "Unfortunately, the truck skidded near the Dongri Police Station and came to a stop.", "On hearing the impact of the accident, the police came out, took both the accused into the Police Station and seized the truck and the goods.", "In short, the. appellant had clearly admitted that these packages containing the contraband goods were imported surreptitiously from Reti Bunder under cover of darkness.", "It was further established de-hors the statement of the appellant, that these packages, on opening by the Customs officer, were found to contain contraband goods of foreign make.", "They were brand new articles packed.", "\n The circumstances of the arrest of the appellant while escaping from the truck, the seizure of the truck and the goods, the contraband nature of the goods, the fact that at the time of the seizure, the goods, were in the charge of the appellant, the fact that no duty on these goods had been paid, the seizure of Rs. 2,000/- as cash from the appellant etc. were proved by evidence aliunde rendered by P. Ws. 1 and 2.", "To some extent, the hostile witness, P.W. 5, also, supported the prosecution.", "The circumstances established unmistakably and irresistibly pointed to the conclusion that the appellant was knowingly concerned in a fraudulent attempt at evasion, if not, fraudulent evasion, of duty chargeable on those contraband goods.", "\n In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed.", "\n M.R.

Court under s. 561A of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the said proceedings.", "The appellants' main contention before the High Court was that the respondent was not an aggrieved party within the meaning of s. 198 of the Code, that he had filed the complaint in his capacity as the chairman. of the reception committee of the conference and not in 'his individual capacity, that in the absence of any reference to him in the said news item he had no cause for complaint, and that the conference being an undefined and an amorphous body, the respondent as a member or part of such a body could not lodge the complaint.", "A learned Single Judge of the High Court, who heard the said applications, rejected the said contention in the following words : \"The Dravida Kazhagam is an identifiable group, The complainant is a member of this Kazhagam.", "He was the Chairman of the Reception Committee in the conference.", "He is active member of the Dravida Kazhagam.", "He was one of those who piloted and sponsored the resolution.", "Certainly be is a person aggrieved                         within the meaning of section 19B of the Criminal procedure Code.", "The complaint by him is competent.\"", "\nThe statement in this para that the respondent piloted and sponsored the resolution in question was factually incorrect, as the respondent's evidence itself showed that the resolution was moved not by him, but by the President of the conference, who read it out and as no one opposed, it was taken to have been approved by all.", "The, only thing which the respondent claimed to have done as the chairman of the reception committee was to give shape to the, draft resolution by abridging it.", "The respondent may have been interested in the resolution and its being passed, but the resolution certainly was neither moved nor piloted by him.", "\nIndeed, if any one could be said to have piloted it, it was the president of the conference.", "Furthermore, the resolution was of the conference and the only contribution of the respondent to it was his having given shape to the original draft.", "\nCounsel for the appellants seriously challenged the correct- ness of the paragraph from the High Court's judgment quoted above, that being the really operative and decisive part of the judgment, firstly, on the ground that those observations were not in consonance with s. 198 of the Code even when read with s. 499, Expl (2) of the Penal Code, and secondly, on the ground of the failure of the High Court to perceive the separate entities of the Dravida Kazhagam and the conference and its omission to realise that the, resolution was the resolution of the Conference and not of the Dravida Kazhagam.", "The news item in question referred to the conference and not to the Dravida Kazhagam, and therefore, if anybody was defamed by the said news item, it was the conference and not the 'Dravida Kazhagam which had only organised that conference.", "Mr. Frank Anthony, on the other hand, urged that though it was the, conference which had passed the resolution and though the news item referred to that conference and not to the Dravida Kazhagam and the respondent was not mentioned or referred to therein, in substance and in effect it was the Dravida Kazhagam which was defamed, for, it was that party which had organised the conference and sponsored the resolutions passed thereat.", "Therefore, the respondent, as a leading member of that party and the chairman of the reception committee, could claim that the defamatory imputations in the said news item were, relatable to him and the other members of the Dravida Kazhagam, and he was consequently entitled to file the complaint.", "On these contentions, the principal question for determina- tion is whether the respondent could be said to be an aggrieved person entitled to maintain the complaint within the meaning of s. 198 of the Code.", "That section lays down that no magistrate shall take cognizance of an offence falling inter alia under Ch. XXI of the Penal Code (that is, ss. 499 to 502) except upon a complaint made by some persons aggrieved of such offence.", "Sec. 198, thus, lays down an exception to the general rule that a complaint 'can be filed by anybody whether he is an aggrieved person or not and modifies that rule by permitting only an aggrieved person to move a magistrate in cases of defamation.", "The section is mandatory, so that if a magistrate were to take cognizance of the, offence of defamation on a complaint filed by one who is not an aggrieved person, the ;trial and conviction of an accused in such a case by the magistrate would be void and illegal.", "\n Prima facie, therefore, if s. 193 of the Code were to be noticed by itself, the complaint in the present case would be unsustainable, since the news item in question did not mention the respondent nor did it contain any defamatory imputation against him individually.", "Sec. 499 of the Penal Code, which defines defamation, laid down that whoever by words, either spoken or intended to be read or by signs etc.\n makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person, intending to harm or knowing or having reason to believe that the imputation will harm he reputation of such person, is said to defame that person.", "This part of the section makes defamation in respect of an individual an offence.", "\n But Explanation (2) to the section lays down the rifle that it may amount to defamation to make an imputation concerning a company or an association or collection of persons as such.", "A defamatory imputation against a collection of persons thus falls within the definition of defamation.", "The languageage of the Explanation is wide, and therefore, besides a company or  an association, any collection of persons would be covered by it  ", "But such a collection of persons must be an identifiable body so that it is possible to say with definiteness that a group of particular persons, as distinguished. from the rest of the community, was defamed", "Therefore, in a case where Explanation (2) is re- sorted to, the identity of the company or the association or the collection of persons must be established so as to be relatable to the defamatory words or imputations.", "Where a writing inveigh,,,, against mankind in a general. or against a particular order of men, e.g., men of own, it is no libel.", "It must descend to particulars and individual-, to make it a libel(1).", "In England also.", "criminal proceedings would lie in the case of libel against a class provided such a class is not indefinite, e.g. men of science.", "but a definite one. such as, the clergy of the diocese of Burham, the (1) (1699)3 Balk 224, cited in Ratanlal and Dhirajlal Law of Crimes (23nd ed.) 1317.\n justices of the peace for the county of Middlesex.", "(see Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law (19th ed.) 235.", "If a well- defined class is defamed, every particular member of that class can file a cornplaint even if the defamatory imputation in question does not mention him by name.", "\n In this connection, counsel for the appellants leaned heavily on K", "nupffer v. London Express Newspaper Ltd.(1).", "The passage printed and published by the respondents and which was the basis of the section there read as follows : \"The quislings on whom Hitler flatters himself he can build a pro-German movement within the Soviet Union are an emigre group called Hlado Russ or Young Russia.", "They are a. minute body professing a pure Fascist ideology who have long sought a suitable Fuehrer-I know with what success.\"", "\nThe appellant, a Russian resident in London, brought the action alleging that the aforesaid words had been falsely and maliciously printed and published of him by the respondents.", "The evidence was that the Young Russia party had a total membership of 2000, that the headquarters of the party were first in Paris but in 1940 were shifted to America.", "The evidence, however, showed that the appellant had joined the party in 1928, that in 1935 he acted as the representative of the party and as the head of the branch in England, which had 24 members.", "The appellant had examined witnesses, all of whom had said that when they read the said article their minds went up to the appellant.", "The House of Lords rejected the action, Lord Simon saying that was an essential element of the cause of action in a libel action that the words complained of should be published of the plaintiff, that where he was not named, the test would be whether the words would reasonably lead people acquainted with him to the conclusion that he was the person referred to.", "The question whether they did so in fact would not arise if they could not in law be regarded as capable of referring to him, and that was not so as the imputations were in regard respect of the party which was in Paris and America.", "Lord Porter agreed with the dismissal of the action but based his decision on the ground that the body defamed had a membership of 2000, which was considerable, a fact vital in considering whether the words in question referred in fact to the appellant.", "The principle laid down here was that there can be no civil action for libel if it relates to a class of persons who are too numerous and unascertainable to join as plaintiffs.", "A single one of them could maintain such an action only if the words complained of were published \" of the plaintiff\", that is to say, if the words were capable of a conclusion that he was the person referred to.", "(see Gatley on (1) [1944] A.C. 116.\n348SupCI/73Libel and Slander (6th ed.) 288.", "Mr. Anthony, however, was right in submitting that the test whether the members of a class defamed are numerous or not would not be apt in a criminal prosecution where technically speaking it is not by the persons injured but by the state that criminal proceedings are carried on and a complaint can lie in a case of libel against a class of persons provided always that such a class is not indeterminate or indefinite but a definite one.", "Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law (19th ed.) 235.", "It is true that where there is an express statutory provision, as in s. 499, Expl. (2), the rules of the Common Law of England cannot be applied.", "But there is no difference in principle between the rule laid down in Explanation (2) to s. 499 and the law applied in such cases in England.", "When, therefore, Expl. (2) to s. 499 talks of a collection of persons as capable of being defamed, such collection of persons must mean a definite and a determinate body.", "\nThis was the construction of Expl. (2) to s. 499 adopted in Sahib Singh Mehra v. U.P.(1) and which guided the decision in that case.", "The article complained of there was one printed and published in the appellant's newspaper called Kaliyug of Aligarh which contained the following : \"How the justice stands at a distance as a helpless spectator of the show as to the manner in which the illicit bribe money from plaintiffs and defendants enters into the pockets of public prosecutors and assistant public prosecutors and the extent to, which it reaches and to which use it is put.\"", "This Court held that the prosecuting staff of Aligarh and even the prosecuting staff in the State of U.P. formed an identifiable group or \"collection of persons\" within the meaning of s. 499, Expl. (2) in the sense that one could with certainty say that a group of persons has been defamed as distinguished from the rest of the community, and therefore, a complaint by the Public Prosecutor and eleven Assistant Public Prosecutors was a competent complaint.", "Following the test laid down in this decision.", "the High Court of Allahabad in Tek Chand v. R. K. Karanjia (2 held that the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak was a definite and an iden- tifiable body, that defamatory imputations regarding it would be defamation within the meaning of s. 499, Exp.

In order to substantiate its case prosecution has examined 2 witnesses in all out of whom P.W. 1 is the independent witness to the seizure and Ext. 2 is the Excise constable.", "Rest one witness has been declined by the learned A.P.P. Ext.s 1 and 1/1 are marked on behalf of the prosecution.", "On the other hand, defence has neither examined any witnesses nor marked any documents as exhibits on its behalf.", "6.

From bare perusal of the Notification, it is clear that a dealer claiming an exemption was supposed to satisfy two conditions, firstly, he should be a registered dealer, and secondly, the purchaser of furniture should be 100% EOU located in the State.", "In the Notification, the registered dealer was supposed to issue Certificate in the prescribed form signed by 100% EOU.", "The Notification further provides that the Certificate issued by the Director of Industries and commerce, Government of Karnataka or Government of India, certifying that it is registered as a 100% EOU and that the said Certificate shall be produced, in proof of its being valid, in each assessment year, within 60 days of commencement of the assessment year.", "\n 6.

We specifically asked learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant whether Certificates issued by the Director of Industries and Commerce, Government of Karnataka or Government of India certifying the purchasers as 100% EOUs were filed before the authorities below, the answer was in the Negative.", "It was submitted that no opportunity was given to the appellant.", "It was further submitted that the only question, the Revisional Authority was supposed to examine, was whether the `furniture' would fall in the category of capital goods so as to claim exemption under the Notification dated 15.11.96.\n ", "In view thereof, on 13.9.13 we had passed the following order: \"Learned counsel for the appellant seeks time till 19.9.2013 to produce copies of the Certificates issued by the Director of Industries & Commerce, Government of Karnataka or Government of India certifying that the purchasers, to whom the appellant sold furniture, are registered as 100% Export Oriented Units (for short the `EOU').", "We have noticed that Revisional Authority has not considered the question whether the `Furniture' would fall in the category of \"Capital Goods\" as contemplated by Notification dated 15.11.1996.", "We, make it clear that, if we are satisfied that the purchasers were having EOU Certificates, we may consider the prayer of learned counsel appearing for the appellant to remand the matter to consider the issue of \"Capital Goods\" with direction to the Revisional Authority to verify genuineness of the Certificates.\"\n       ", "In view of the above order, learned counsel appearing for the appellant placed before us six Certificates issued in favour of the six units, to whom, the appellant had supplied Furniture during the relevant financial year.", "7.

", "The plea of the deence is one of complete denial and false implication.", "4.

The petitioner is a registered dealer under the provisions of the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 (Hereinafter referred to as the `KVAT Act', for brevity) and is engaged in the manufacture and sale of rice bran oil, cotton seed oil, sunflower oil and soya oil, by employing solvent extraction process out of rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake, and soya seeds.", "While oil is liable to tax and the by-product de- oiled bran and cake is exempted from tax.", "The petitioner claims that returns of turnover in Form VAT 100 for the tax periods April 2006 to March 2007, April 2007 to March 2008, April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 were filed compiled on the basis of books of accounts and the tax was paid as admitted therein.", "In the said returns filed, the petitioner had claimed partial input rebate in terms of section 17 of the KVAT Act in respect of rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake and soya seeds used as input in the extraction of oil on the understanding of the law while filing returns that it was not eligible for full input tax rebate.", "The said returns are deemed as accepted under section 38(1) of the KVAT Act.", "\n 3. The first respondent audited the books of account for the tax periods April 2006 to March 2007, April 2007 to March 2008, April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 and had passed re-assessment orders under section 39(1) of the KVAT Act levying tax, penalty and interest.", "In doing so, the prescribed authority had allowed the partial input rebate as per Section 17 of the KVAT Act, on the value of inputs namely, rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake and soya seed used in the extraction of oil on the understanding of law that the petitioner is not eligible for full input tax rebate.", "\n 4. Subsequent to the filing of the returns, a division bench of this court has rendered its judgment in M.K.Agro Tech Private Limited vs. State of Karnataka, 2014(18) KLJ 1, to the effect that when an assessee is in the business of manufacture of only one product, namely, oil and which is liable to tax, merely because in the process of manufacture of oil, certain by-product arises, which is sold and which is exempted from tax, that would not attract the provisions of Section 17 of the KVAT Act relating to partial rebate.", "This was the declaratory of the law and according to the petitioner, would always have been applicable to all assessments made prior to and after the date of the said judgment.", "Therefore, the petitioner has filed an application under Section 69(1) relating to the tax period April 2006 to March 2007, April 2007 to March 2008, April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 before the first respondent, for rectification of the re-assessment orders and to grant full input tax rebate on the value of VAT.", "That was rejected only on the ground that the petitioner ought to have made a claim for full tax rebate in the first instance and no such claim having been made would preclude it from doing so, since such a claim could have been made only within a period of six months and not beyond that and", "hence, the question of considering the case of the petitioner for such full tax rebate would not arise.", "Insofar as the judgment in M.K.Agro Tech, supra, is concerned, it is applied in favour of the assesses from the date of judgment and there can be no second opinion, though the revenue has sought to challenge the same before the apex court and is pending consideration.", "5. The learned Government Advocate, while justifying the order, would submit that the question of rectification would not arise and it is a misconception on the part of the petitioner that they could file such a rectification application within a period of five years.", "Since the statute was clear even as on the date the claim was made and in the absence of any such claim, the petitioner now seeking to raise such a claim by hindsight, notwithstanding that it is only after the judgment was delivered by a division bench in M.K.Agro Tech, supra, in that, it has dawned on the petitioner that it could have made such an application, cannot be countenanced and seeks to contend that if any such benefit is given, the revenue would suffer serious loss.", "\n 6. By way of reply, the learned Senior Advocate would point out that it is unfair on the part of the revenue to contend that such a claim should have been made in the first instance and that the petitioner is precluded from raising such a claim as on date, as it was a mutually understood position of law which prevented the assessees from raising such claim.", "For otherwise, if such claim had been made, it was quite possible that they would have been penalized for making such a claim and it is only on the legal position being settled by a decision of a division bench of this court that the benefit available to the petitioner has dawned on the petitioner and therefore, the rectification application was justified.", "7. The point for consideration would be whether the petitioner could avail the benefit of the judgment which was rendered much after the assessment order was passed and whether such reassessment orders can be passed on their prayer for rectification of the earlier assessment.", "\n 8. In the above circumstances, in a situation where if the revenue were to be in the position of the assessee and if it was discovered that by virtue of the operation of law, the revenue was entitled to a certain amount from the dealers, it would have certainly turned the tables on the assessee and proceeding on that presumption, it would be only just and fair to direct the revenue to consider the prayer of the petitioner for rectification, when there is no dispute that they were entitled to full tax rebate by virtue of the decision in M.K.Agro Tech, supra.", "It would be a formality for the respondent to pass a rectification order and grant full tax rebate to the petitioner in terms of its prayer.", "The petitions are allowed.", "The impugned orders are set aside with direction to the first respondent to redo the same and give the petitioner the full benefit of the judgment in M.K.Agro Tech, supra.", "\n The respondent having challenged the judgment in M.K.Agro Tech,supra, before the apex court, there is no order of stay.", "Therefore, having regard to the law laid down by this court, the respondents are bound to comply.", "\n Sd/- JUDGE nv"]}]
