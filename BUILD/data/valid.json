The accused is in appeal in the following circumstances:- The appellant was accused of offences punishable under Sections 498A and 306 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (Hereinafter referred to as the `IPC', for brevity).", "The complainant Sonabai was a resident of Hanumantwadi in Basavakalyan Taluk, Bidar District.", "She had two daughters, Laxmibai and Sangeeta.", "She had lost her husband about 12 years prior to the complaint.", "She had performed the marriage of her elder daughter Laxmi six years prior to the complaint.", "Lakshmi was married to the present appellant.", "It is claimed that the accused had looked after Lakshmi well till the birth of their first child, which was a girl and he was not happy with the girl child and thereafter started ill-treating Lakshmi, apart from which, he was also demanding dowry and on that pretext, he used to assault her continuously.\n", "In this regard, it is the complainant's case that Laxmi had repeatedly told her about the ill-treatment.", "The complainant however had consoled her daughter and had assured her that she would advise the accused to take better care of her.", "It is the complainant's further case that in this regard, she along with her son Ramakrishna and Goudappa Patil went to the house of accused at Suntan village and had advised the accused not to ill-treat Lakshmi by demanding money, as they could ill- afford any such dowry.", "However, on 7.3.2008, she had received a message from Jaganath of Suntan village, that at about 10 p.m., her daughter Laxmi and grand-daughter Bhagewati had died of drowning in a well.", "The complainant, Ramakrishna and Goudappa Patil did rush to the Suntan village and saw the dead body of her daughter and grand-daughter and then lodged a complaint against the accused.", "Based on which, a case was registered on 8.3.2008 and a report was submitted to the Court of the JMFC.", "An inquest mahazar was conducted of the deceased and the bodies were sent for post-mortem and after taking further steps, a charge sheet was submitted against the accused as on 17.9.2008.", "The case was committed to the sessions court for trial, which framed charges against the accused and the accused having pleaded not guilty and having claimed to be tried, the prosecution had examined 17 witness and marked 11 documents and 3 material objects.", "On conclusion of the trial and on examination of the accused under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the court below had framed the following points for consideration:- 1.", "Whether the prosecution proves that accused has given ill-treatment to deceased Laxmi by demanding her to bring money from her parental house?", "\n 2. Whether the prosecution proves that accused has subjected deceased Laxmi to cruelty to such an extent that deceased Laxmi has committed suicide on 17.3.2008?", "3. The court below answered the above points in the affirmative and accordingly had convicted the accused to undergo simple imprisonment for three years and pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- for the offence punishable under section 498-A IPC and 10 years simple imprisonment and to pay fine of Rs.10,000/- for the offence punishable under Section 306 of the IPC.", "It is that which is under challenge in the present appeal.", "\n 4. learned Counsel for the appellant would submit that the case of the prosecution rests entirely on the evidence of PWs.8 to 11.", "PW.8 is the mother of the deceased Laxmi, PW.9 is the brother, PW.10 is the sister and PW.11 is an elder of the village.", "It is their consistent evidence that Laxmi was constantly complaining about the appellant ill-treating her complaining that she had produced a female child when he wanted a male child and further that she had not fetched enough dowry and therefore she should bring some more money.", "It is further reiterated that the complainant along with her son and Goudappa Patil had advised him to take better care of Laxmi and that they were all aware of the continuous harassment meted out to Laxmi, which had instigated her to take the extreme step of committing suicide along with her daughter and therefore, the offences punishable under sections 498A and 306 of the IPC are made out.", "The learned Counsel would point out that PWs.1 to 6, who were the witnesses belonging to the village of the appellant, namely Suntan village, had all turned hostile and not supported the case of the prosecution.", "They were the best persons, according to the prosecution, who had made statements of the appellant being seen ill-treating Laxmi and since that was the sheet anchor of the prosecution case and in the face of those witnesses having been treated as hostile witnesses, they had apparently been compelled to furnish such statements by the hands of the Police and this, therefore explains the circumstance that all of them, without exception, have turned hostile at the trial.", "The only evidence on which the prosecution and the court below however placed reliance is on the evidence PWs.8 to 11.", "First of all, those witnesses did not have any direct knowledge nor is it their case that they have seen the appellant ill-treating the deceased or instigate her to commit suicide.", "It is their own case that Laxmi had on and off informed them of such ill-treatment.", "Therefore, in the absence of any direct evidence of ill-treatment or instigation by the appellant, it cannot be said that the prosecution has made out any case insofar as offences punishable under Sections 498A and 306 of the IPC are concerned.", "\n In this regard, the learned Counsel for the appellant places reliance on a decision of the Supreme Court in S.S.Chheena vs. Vijay Kumar Mahajan and another, 2010(4) Crimes 101 and would submit that even if the evidence of PWs.8 to 11, is taken on its face value, it cannot be treated as direct evidence, which could establish the charges under the sections aforesaid and hence pleads that the judgment be set aside and the appellant be acquitted.", "\n 5. le", "the learned Government Pleader would seek to justify the judgment of the court below and would point out that it is the consistent evidence of PWs.8 to 11 that there was constant ill-treatment, soon after the birth of Bhagewati, by the appellant to the deceased Laxmi, which has driven her to commit suicide.", "The constant taunting and harassment would certainly amount to instigation to commit suicide.", "As has been laid down in a catena of decisions, the ill-treatment by the husband within the four walls of the house would hardly be witnessed by others.", "The unfortunate circumstance that PWs.1 to 6, who did make statements in the first instance of they having seen the ill-treatment meted out to the deceased, having turned hostile, does not negate the evidence of other witnesses.", "\nThe fact of ill-treatment is narrated first hand by the deceased time and again to the complainant and others, as consistently stated by them.", "Therefore, the cruelty is writ large in the circumstances of the case, as has been demonstrated by the extreme step taken by the deceased not only to kill herself, but also to put an end to the life of her daughter Bhagewati, as apparently, the deceased did not want her daughter also to go through the very ordeal that she had experienced.", "That was the clinching factor.", "It is only the near and dear ones of the victim, who would have knowledge of the details of ill- treatment and harassment and the independent witness, PW.11 having also been a well-wisher of the family, who had constantly kept in view the welfare of the family and also having declared that he had visited the appellant after he had constantly ill-treated Laxmi, to advise him to take better care of her, in the presence of the mother of the deceased and her brother", ", cannot be overlooked.", "He was not in any way related to the complainant or her family and he had no ill-will against the accused.", "He was an elder of the village and has withstood the test of cross-examination.", "Therefore, the court below having placed reliance on the testimony of PWs.8 to 11 is not to be faulted and the death of Laxmi within six years from her marriage, would raise a presumption against the husband in terms of the law and the facts in the present case on hand would clearly indicate that there was constant harassment and instigation, which had driven Laxmi to commit suicide, who has also taken her daughter with her in committing suicide.", "\n 6. Given the rival contentions, as pointed out by the learned Counsel for the appellant, in order to bring home the charge of an offence punishable under Section 498A IPC, it is necessary to prove that there was cruelty.", "There was nothing on record to indicate that the family of Laxmi was incapable of providing any dowry, given the fact that her father was no more and that they were not well of and the marriage having taken place six years prior to the incident, the demand for dowry coming at a late stage, would not raise any presumption of such demand in the absence of any direct evidence.", "It is only to bring the case within the scope of Section 498A that such an allegation is made.", "Therefore, to hold that the prosecution had established its case beyond all reasonable doubt insofar as the offence punishable under section 498A cannot be presumed merely on the basis of the evidence of PWs.8 to 11.", "Insofar as the offence punishable under section 306 of the IPC, is concerned, again would require the prosecution to establish the circumstance that there was instigation by the appellant on Lakshmi to commit suicide and that he had intentionally driven her and his daughter to commit suicide.", "\n The apex court, in the decision cited by the learned Counsel for the appellant, in S.S.Chheena vs. Vijaya Kumar Mahajan and another, 2010 (4) Crimes 101, has discussed and reviewed the case law in this regard, with reference to the following authorities :- Mahendra Singh vs. State of M.P., 1995 Supp (3) SCC 731", "In this case, the allegations levelled against the accused were as follows: \" I...", "My mother-in-law and husband and sister-in-law (husband's elder brother's wife) harassed me.", "My husband Mahendra wants to marry a second time.", "He has illicit connections with my sister-in-law.", "Because of these reasons and being harassed, I want to die by burning\"\n ", "The court concluded that by no stretch of imagination, the ingredients of abetment are attracted on the statement of the deceased.", "In Ramesh Kumar vs. State of Chhattisgarh, (2001)9 SCC 618, a three-judge bench of the apex court had occasion to deal with a case of similar nature.", "In an argument between a husband and wife, the husband had stated that \"you are free to do whatever you wish and go wherever you like\".", "\nThereafter, the wife is said to have committed suicide.", "The apex court, in that circumstance, examined the different shades of the meaning of \"instigation\" as hereunder:- \"20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do `an act'.", "To satisfy the requirement of instigation though it is not necessary that actual words must be used to that effect or what constitutes instigation must necessarily and specifically be suggestive of the consequence.", "Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the consequence must be capable of being spelt out.", "\n               The present one is not a case where the accused had by his acts or omission or by a continued course of conduct created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide in which case an instigation may have been inferred.", "A word uttered in the fit of anger or emotion without intending the consequences to actually follow cannot be said to be instigation.\"", "In State of West Bengal vs. Orilal Jaiswal, (1994)1 SCC 73, the apex court has expressed that the court should be extremely careful in assessing the facts and circumstances of each case and the evidence adduced in the trial court for the purpose of finding whether cruelty meted out to the victim had in fact induced her to end life by committing suicide.", "If it appears to the court that a victim committing suicide was hyper sensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and differences in domestic life quite common to the society to which the victim belonged and such petulance, discord and differences were not expected to induce a similarly circumstanced individual in a given society to commit suicide, the conscience of the court should not be satisfied for basing a finding that the accused charged of abetting the offence of suicide should be found guilty.", "\n In Chitresh Kumar Chopra vs. State, (2009) 16 SCC 605, the court dealt with the meaning of the word \"instigation\"\nand \"goading\".", "The court has opined that there should be intention to provoke, incite or encourage the doing of an act by the latter.", "Each person's suicidability pattern is different from the other.", "Each person has his own idea of self-esteem and self-respect.", "Therefore, it is impossible to lay down any straitjacket formula in dealing with such cases.", "Each case has to be decided on the basis of its own facts and circumstances.", "\nAbetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing.", "Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.", "The intention of the legislature and the ratio of the cases decided by the apex court were clear that in order to convict a person under section 306 of the IPC, there has to be a clear mens rea to commit the offence and it also requires an active act or direct act which lead the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and that act must have been intended to push the deceased into such a position that he committed suicide.\n ", "The above being the settled legal position insofar as abetment of suicide is concerned, in the absence of any direct evidence of the appellant having driven the deceased to commit suicide, the possibility of the deceased having been hyper sensitive to the alleged demand of the appellant, that he wanted a male child and having regard to the aspect that the latent or patent suicidal tendencies of an individual are not to be placed in a straitjacket formula, the actual state of mind of Laxmi in having committed suicide, cannot be attributed to any instigation or abetment by the appellant in her having committed suicide, along with her only child.", "It is also possible that sheer frustration of not having borne a male child, which the appellant is alleged to have desired, may have also driven her to commit suicide.", "Even if it was her case that she was being harassed and ill-treated, there was no such allegation of harassment and ill-treatment of the young child.", "In that view of the matter, it cannot be concluded with any certainty that there was constant cruelty meted out to Lakshmi and that there was abetment of the commission of suicide by Laxmi.", "In that view of the matter, the finding of the court below based entirely on the evidence of PW.8 to 11 cannot be sustained.", "\n In the result, the appeal is allowed.", "The judgment of the court below is set aside.", "The appellant is acquitted.", "The fine amount, if any, paid by the appellant shall be refunded.", "\n The office is directed to communicate this order to the jail authorities of the Central Jail, Gulbarga, to set the appellant at liberty as he has been in custody for the past three years.", "\n Sd/- JUDGE nv"]}, {"labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 1, 3, 3, 3, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 4, 12, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,

(2) of s. 10 of the Act.", "The Sales Tax Officer passed separate orders assessing the tax for all the seven quarters simultaneously on October 9, 1947.", "He assessed the tax on a taxable turnover of Rs.\n2,94,000 for each of the five quarters ending December 31, 1945, March 31, 1946, September 30, 1946, December 31, 1946 and March 31, 1947; for the other two quarters ending on June 30, 1946, and June 30, 1947, he assessed the tax on a taxable turnover of Rs. 3,92,000.", "The assessee then moved in appeal the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Tirhut Division, but the Commissioner dismissed the appeals by his order dated February 23, 1948.", "The Board of Revenue was then moved in revision but, by its order dated July 31, 1948, the Board refused to interfere.", "The Board expressedthe view that the finding of the Sales Tax Officer and the Commissioner that the books of account maintained by the assessee were not dependable was a finding of fact which could not be interfered with in revision ; -therefore the assessing officer was bound to assess to' the best of his judgment.", "The Board was then moved under s. 21 of the Act to refer certain questions of law to the High Court of Patna which, the assessee contended, arose out of its order.", "By its order dated December 10, 1948, the Board rejected the applications for making a reference to the High Court on the same ground, namely, that no question of law was involved and the assessment orders were concluded by a concurrent finding of fact.", "The assessee then moved the High Court and by its order dated April 27, 1949, passed in Miscellaneous Judicial Cases Nos. 13 to 19 of of 1949, the High Court directed the Board of Revenue to state a case on the following question: \" Whether the Sales Tax.Officer is entitled under section 10(2)(b) of the Act to make an assessment on any figures of gross turnover without giving any basis to justify the adoption of that figure ?\"", "\nThe Board of Revenue then stated a case, and the High Court disposed of the reference by answering the question in the affirmative by its judgment and order dated January 8, 1952.", "\nThe assessee then moved this Court and obtained special leave to appeal from the said judgment and order of the High Court.", "\n The main contention of the assessee is that the High Court has not correctly answered the question of law referred to it.", "Before we proceed to consider this contention of the assessee, it is necessary to clear the ground by delimiting the precise scope of the question referred to the High Court.", "It is well settled that the jurisdiction of the High Court in the' matter of incometax references is an advisory jurisdiction and under the Income-tax Act the decision of the Tribunal on facts is final, unless it can be successfully assailed on the ground that there was no evidence for the conclusion on facts recorded by the Tribunal or the conclusion was such as no reasonable body of persons could have arrived at.", "It is also well settled that the dutyof the High Court is to start with the statement of the case as the final statement of the facts and to answer the question of law with reference to that statement.", "The provisions of the Indian Income-tax Act are in pari materia with the provisions of the Act under our consideration, the main scheme of the relevant provisions of the two Acts being similar in nature, though the wording of the provisions is not exactly the same.", "Under s. 21 of the Act, the High Court exercises a similar advisory jurisdiction, and under sub-s. (3) of that section, the High Court may require the Board of Revenue to state a case and refer it to the High Court, when the High Court is satisfied that the refusal of the Board to make a reference to the High Court under sub-s.\n(2) is not justified.", "Under sub-s. (5) of s. 21 the High Court hears the reference and decides the question of law referred to it, giving in a judgment the grounds of its decision.", "In the case under our consideration, the question which was referred to the High Court related to the assessments made under s. 10(2)(b) of the Act; in other words, the question related to those four quarters only for which the assessments were made under s. 10(2)(b).", "The question did not relate to the three quarters for which the assessee had filed no returns and assessments were made under s. 10(4) of the Act.", "At one place in its judgment, the High Court referred to a slight inaccuracy in the question framed, but it did not reframe the question so as to widen its scope and include the three quarters for which assessments were made under s. 10(4) of the Act.", "The question, as it stood and as it was answered by the High Court, did not relate to the propriety or legality of the assessments made under s. 10(4) of the Act.", "We must, therefore, make it clear at the very outset that the question relates to those four quarters only for which assessments were made under s. 10(2)(b) of the Act, and the answer given to the question will govern those four quarters only.", "Having thus indicated the precise scope of the question referred to the High Court, we proceed now to consider the main contention of the assessee.", "We must first read the relevant provisions of the statuteunder which the assessments were made.", "Sub-section (1) of s. 10 of the Act states that if the Commissioner is satisfied without requiring the presence of a registered dealer or the production by him of any evidence that the returns furnished in respect of any period are correct and complete, he shall assess the amount of tax due from the dealer on the basis of such returns.", "Clause (a) of sub-s.\n(2) states what the Commissioner shall do, if he is not satisfied without requiring the presence of a registered dealer who furnished the returns or production of evidence that the returns furnished in respect of any period are correct and complete; the clause states that in that event the Commissioner shall serve on the dealer a notice in the prescribed manner requiring him either to attend in person or to produce or cause to be produced any evidence on which such dealer may rely in support of his returns.", "Then comes cl. (b) of sub-s. (2) which must be quoted in extenso: \" (b) On the day specified in the notice or as soon afterwards as may be, the Commissioner, after hearing such evidence as the dealer may produce, and such other evidence as the Commissioner may require on specified points, shall assess the amount of tax due from the dealer.\"", "\nThese provisions are similar to the provisions contained in s. 23 of the Indian Income-tax Act.", "Sub-section (1) of s.\n10 of the Act corresponds to sub-s. (1) of s. 23 of the Indian Income-tax Act; clause (a) of sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act corresponds to sub-s. (2) of s. 23 of the Indian Income-tax Act; and clause (b) of sub-s. (2) of S. 10 of the Act corresponds to sub-s. (3) of s. 23 of the Indian Income- tax Act, though there are some verbal differences between the two provisions.", "Sub-section (3) of s. 23 of the Indian Income-tax Act requires the Income-tax Officer to assess the total income of the assessee and determine the sum payable by him on the basis of such assessment, by \"an order in writing\"; but cl. (b) of sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act requires the Commissioner to assess the amount of tax due from the dealer and does not impose any liability as to \"an order in writing.\"", "In spite of these differences, thetwo provisions are substantially the same and impose on the assessing authority a duty to assess the tax after hearing such evidence as the dealer may produce and such other evidence as the assessing authority may require on specified points.", "\nThe point for our consideration is-can the assessing authority, purporting to act under s. 10(2)(b) of the Act, assess the amount of tax due from a dealer more or less arbitrarily or without basing the assessment on any materials whatsoever ?", "In the question referred to the High Court, the expression used is, \"make an assessment on any figure of gross turnover without giving any basis to justify the adoption of that figure\".", "That expression is perhaps a little ambiguous, but read in the context of the statement of the case, the question can only mean this: can the assessing authority adopt a figure of gross turnover by pure guess and without referring to any materials on which the figure is based ?", "It is clear to us that, understood in that sense, the High Court has answered the question incorrectly.", "The High Court went into an elaborate consideration, by way of comparison and contrast, of sub-s.\n(4) and el. (b) of sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act.", "It is unnecessary for us to make any pronouncement in this appeal with regard to the precise scope of sub-s. (4) of s. 10 of the Act, which corresponds more or less to sub-s. (4) of s.\n23 of the Indian Income-tax Act; nor is it necessary for us to decide if an assessment made under el. (b) of sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act", ", when the account books of the assessee are disbelieved, stands exactly on the same footing as an assessment made under sub-s. (4) of s. 10 when the assessee has failed to furnish his returns.", "In some decisions relating to the corresponding provisions of the Indian Income-tax Act, it has been said that the difference between the two is one of degree only, the one being more summary than the other.", "These are questions which do not really fall for decision in the present appeal, which is confined to interpreting the true nature and scope of el. (b) of sub- s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act.", "With regard to the corresponding provision in sub-s. (3) of s. 23 of the Indian Income-tax Act, there is a decision of thisCourt which, in our opinion, answers the question before us.", "\nThe decision is that of Dhakeswari Cotton Mills Ltd. v.\nCommissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal(1).", "This Court observed: \"As regards the second contention, we are in entire agreement with the learned Solicitor-General when he says that the Income-tax Officer is not fettered by technical rules of evidence and pleadings, and that he is entitled to act on material which may not be accepted as evidence in a Court of law, but there the agreement ends; because it is equally clear that in making the assessment under sub-s. (3) of s. 23 of the Act, the Income-tax Officer is not entitled to make a pure guess and make an assessment without reference to any evidence or any material at all.", "There must be something more than bare suspicion to support the assessment under s. 23(3).\"", "\nIn our view, the aforesaid observations clearly show that the High Court was in error in answering the question in the affirmative.", "Firstly, the High Court treated the question referred to it as a pure question of fact; if that were so, then the High Court should have rejected the reference on the ground that it was not competent to answer a question of fact.", "Then, the High Court proceeded to consider certain decisions relating to the interpretation of sub-ss. (3) and (4) of s. 23 of the Indian Income-tax Act, and held that there was no difference between an assessment under sub-s.\n(3) and an assessment under sub-s. (4) of s. 23.", "The High Court applied the same analogy and on that footing held that there being no difference between an assessment under cl.\n(b) of sub-s. (2) and an assessment under sub-s. (4) of s.\n10 of the Act, the answer to the question must be in the affirmative.", "In our view, the approach of the High Court to the question referred to it was erroneous and the answer given to the question by it solely on the basis of sub-s.\n(4) of s. 10 of the Act was vitiated by that wrong approach.", "\nIt was not sub-s. (4) of s. 10 of the Act which the High Court had to consider; it had to consider the true scope and effect of cl. (b) of sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act.", "\n(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 941, 949.Learned counsel for the respondent has strongly urged two points in support of the answer which the High Court gave.", "\nFirstly, he has contended that, on a proper reading of the assessment orders and the orders of the Commissioner, it would appear that the gross turnover for the quarters in question was based on certain materials; therefore, the argument of learned counsel is that it is not correct to say that the figure of gross turnover was arbitrarily adopted or was adopted without reference to any evidence or any material at all.", "We have examined the assessment orders in question, which form part of the statement of the case.", "It is clear to us that what the Sales Tax Officer and the Commissioner did was to hold, for certain reasons, that the returns made by the assessee and the books of account filed by it were incorrect and undependable.", "It is not necessary to repeat those reasons, because we must accept the finding of fact arrived at by the assessing authorities that the returns and the books of account were not dependable.", "The assessing authorities rightly pointed out that several transactions were not entered in the books of account; and a surprise inspection made on July 15, 1947, disclosed certain transactions with a Bombay firm known as Messrs. Kishundas Lekhraj, which were not mentioned in the books of account; and finally, the assessee Was importing silver in the name of five confederates in order to suppress the details of the transactions etc.", "The assessing authorities further pointed out that there was a discrepancy between the return filed for the quarter ending June 30, 1946, and the accounts filed in support of it; the return showed a gross turnover of Rs.\n2,28,370-12-0 while the accounts revealed a gross turnover of Rs. 1,48,204.", "All these we must accept as correct.", "\nHaving rejected the returns and the books of account, the assessing authorities proceeded to estimate the gross turnover.", "In so estimating the gross turnover, they did not refer to any materials at all.", "On the contrary, they indulged in a pure guess and adopted a figure without reference to any evidence or any material at all.", "Let us take, for example, the assessment order for the quarter ending June 30, 1946.The", "Sales Tax Officer said: \"I reject the dealer's accounts and estimate a gross turnover of Rs. 4,00,000.", "1 allow a deduction at 2% on the turnover and assess him on Rs.\n3,92,000 to pay sales tax of Rs. 6,125.\"", "For the quarter ending on September 30, 1946, the Sales Tax Officer said: \"I reject his irregular account and estimate a gross turnover of Rs. 3,00,000 for the quarter and assess him on Rs.\n2,94,000 to pay tax of Rs. 4,593-12-0.\"", "These and similar orders do not show that the assessment was made with reference to any evidence or material; on the contrary, they show that having rejected the books of account, the assessing authorities indulged in -pure guess and made an assessment without reference-to any evidence or any material at all.", "This the assessing authorities were not entitled to do under cl. (b) of sub.s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act.", "\nSecondly, learned counsel for the respondent has referred us to several decisions on which the High Court relied and has argued that on the basis of those decisions, it must be held that the answer given by the High Court to the question referred to it was a correct answer.", "We propose to examine briefly some of those decisions, though, as we have stated earlier, the question is really answered by the observations made by this Court in Dhakeswari Cotton Mills' case (1).", "\nThe first decision is the Privy Council decision in Income- tax Commissioner v. Badridas Ramrai Shop, Akola (2).", "Lord Russell of Killowen in delivering the judgment of their Lordships made the following observations as respects a \"\nbest of judgment \" assessment within the meaning of s. 23 (4) of the Indian Income-tax Act: \" The officer is to make an assessment to the best of his judgment against a person who is in default as regards supplying information.", "He must not act dishonestly, or vindictively or capriciously, because he must exercise judgment in the matter.", "He must make what he honestly believes to be a fair estimate of the proper figure of assessment, and for this purpose he must, their Lordships think, be able to take into consideration local knowledge and repute in regard to the assessee's circumstances, and his own knowledge of previous returns by, and assessments of, the assessee, (1) [1955] S.C.R. 94I, 949.\n(2) (1937) 64 I.A. 102, 114-115.and all other matters which he thinks will assist him in arriving at a fair and proper estimate: and though there must necessarily be guess-work in the matter, it must be honest guess-work.", "\"\nWe find nothing in those observations which runs counter to the observations made in Dhakeswari Cotton Mills' case(1).\nNo doubt it is true that when the returns and the books of account are rejected, the assessing officer must make an estimate, and to that extent he must make a guess; but the estimate must be related to some evidence or material and it must be something more than mere suspicion.", "To use the words of Lord Russell of Killowen again, \" he must make what he honestly believes to be a fair estimate of the proper figure of assessment\" and for this purpose he must take into consideration such materials as the assessing officer has before him, including the assessee's circumstances, knowledge of previous returns and all other matters which the assessing officer thinks will assist him in arriving at a fair and proper estimate.", "In the case under our consideration, the assessing officer did not do so, and that is where the grievance of the assessee arises.", "\nThe next decision is Ganga Ram Balmokand v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Punjab (2).", "It was held therein that where the income-tax authorities were not satisfied with the correctness or completeness of the assessees' accounts and, taking into consideration the state of affairs in general and the fact that the assessees had a large business and the profit shown by them was abnormally low in comparison with that of other persons carrying on the same business in the locality, calculated the taxable income by applying a flat rate of 7 per cent., the authorities were justified in applying such a flat rate, and the burden was on the assessees to displace the estimate.", "There again, the estimate made was not a pure guess and was based on some materials which the Income-tax Officer had before him.", "Din Mohammad J. who gave the leading judgment, observed: \" It cannot be denied that there must be some material before the Income-tax Officer on which (1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 941, 949.\n(2) [1937] 5 I.T.R. 464.to base his estimate, but no hard and fast rule can be laid down by the Court to define what sort of material is required on which his estimate can be founded.\"", "With that observation we generally agree.", "If, in this case, the Sales Tax authorities had based their estimate on some material before them, no objection could have been taken; but the question which was referred to the High, Court and which arose out of the orders of assessment was whether it was open to the said authorities to make an assessment on a figure of gross, turnover, without referring to any materials to justify the adoption of that figure.", "In answering that question in the affirmative, the High Court has given a carte blanche to the Sales Tax authorities and has, in our opinion, misdirected itself as to the true scope and effect of cl. (b) of sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act.", "\nThe next decision is Gunda Subbayya v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras (1).", "This decision also does not help the respondent.", "It was held in that decision that though there is nothing in the Indian Income-tax Act which imposes a duty on an Incometax Officer, who makes an assessment under s. 23 (3), to disclose to the assessee the material on which he proposes to act, natural justice requires that he should draw the assessee's attention to it and give him an opportunity to show that the officer's information is wrong and he should also indicate in his order the material on which he has made his estimate.", "This decision is really against the respondent and does not lay down any rule which may be said to be inconsistent with the observations made by this Court in Dhakeswari Cotton Mills' case (2).", "\nThe decision of the Lahore High Court in Seth Gurmukh Singh v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Punjab (3) was specifically approved by this Court in Dhakeswari Cotton Mills' case (2).", "The rules laid down in that decision were these: (1) While proceeding under sub-s. (3) of s. 23 of the Income-tax Act, the Income-tax Officer is not bound to -rely on such evidence produced by the assessee as he considers to be false; (2) if he proposes to make an estimate in disregard of (1) [1939] 7 I.T.R. 2 1.\n(2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 941, 949.\n(3) [1944] 12 I.T.R. 393.the evidence, oral or documentary, led by the assessee, he should in fairness disclose to the assessee the material on which he is going to found that estimate; (3) he is not however debarred from relying on private sources of information, which sources he may not disclose to the assessee at all; and (4) in case he proposes to use against the assessee the result of any private inquiries made by him, he must communicate to the assessee the substance of the information so proposed to be utilised to such an extent as to put the assessee in possession of full particulars of the case he is expected to meet and should further give him ample opportunity to meet it, if possible.", "The decision does not lay down that it is open to the Income-tax Officer to make an estimate on pure guess and without reference to any material or evidence before him.", "\nThe last decision to which we have been referred is the decision in Malik Damsaz Khan v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1).", "That again is a decision of the Privy Council.", "In that case, the validity of the assessment under s. 23 (3) of the Indian Income-tax Act was not challenged by the assessee and the appeal was directed solely to the amount of assessment.", "Their Lordships observed: 'But it appears to them that it was clearly competent for the Income-tax Officer in the circumstances of the present case to accept the return as a valid return and proceed to assessment under section 23 (1) or section 23 (3) as the case might be.", "Since he was not satisfied that the return was correct and complete he could not proceed under section 23 (1); he, therefore, as appeared upon the face of the assessment, proceeded under section 23 (3).", "Neither in the incompleteness of the return nor in the fact that in any accompanying statement the appellant referred to his return as an estimate can their Lordships find any possible justification for the plea that the assessment was incompetent or that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal proceedings which the appellant himself initiated. \"\n(1) [1947] 15 I.T.R. 445.These observations do not help the respondent in any way; nor do they lay down any rule contrary to the rules laid down in Seth Gurmukh Singh's case (1).", "For these reasons we hold that the High Court, was in error in answering the question referred to it.", "The appeal is accordingly allowed and the judgment and order of the High Court are set aside.", "The answer to the question referred to the High Court is in the negative.", "The appellant will be entitled to its costs both in this Court and in the High Court."]}, {"labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 6, 6, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 10, 11, 11, 12], "segments": ["PETITIONER:\nP.K.

were acquitted and we are not concerned with them except to note that they were not concerned with that part of the occurrence which we have set out as steps 6 and 7 above.", "The charge against the remaining eleven can be divided into two parts.", "Under the first, each, except Sukha, is charged with beating the Baories Parsia, Mana, Govinda, Ganesh, Chhotiya, Seruri, etc. \"along with other accused\".", "Five of the eleven are said to 293 have beaten them with \"swords and lathis\"; another five \"with lathis, etc.\" while the eleventh, Sukha, is said to have fired at Parsia and Mana \"as a result of which they fell down\".", "Then each charge continues-- \"and when all had fallen down as a result of these injuries\".", "After that the charges divide off into three groups: One group charges (1) Gumana, (2) Naraina, (3) Balia and (4) Jankiya with beating Govinda and Mana, \"who were groaning, with lathis with intent to kill them till they were actually killed\".", "The next group charges (1) Jeewana, (2) Sukha and (3) Chokhla with hitting Parsia with lathi blows \"with intent to murder him till he died\".", "The third group charges (1) Begla, (2) Govinda, (3) Kumla and (4) Bhawana with as- saulting Ganesh with lathis with intent to murder till he died.", "\nThe following sentence was also added in the end of each of these charges: \"And you did this as a member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of its common intention\".", "\nThere has been some confusion in both the Sessions Court and the High Court between \"common intention\" and \"common object\".", "It is true the two sometimes overlap but they are used in different senses in law and should be kept distinct.", "\nIn a case of unlawful assembly or riot we are concerned with a common object.", "However, we are satisfied that has not caused any prejudice.", "But the reason why we have set out these charges at some length is because counsel for the appellants argued that the prosecution case is that there were two separate assemblies, one of twenty five persons to beat six specific persons and another of eleven to kill them in three groups.", "He argued that the twenty five who constituted the first assembly have all been acquitted; that the only material from which an unlawful assembly can be inferred in the other case is the instigation of Sukha and Gumana for a second time after they bad returned from chasing Lachhuri.", "That story, he said, has been disbelieved, so all must be acquitted.", "\n It will be necessary at this stage to set out the 294 findings of the two lower courts.", "The learned Sessions Judge starts by rejecting the evidence of Ruga (P.W. 1), Bodu (P.W. 2) and Bhagwatia (P.W. 3) on the question of identification of any of the accused and the evidence of Arjun (P.W. 4) about the conspiracy to beat up the Baories.\n ", "But he finds that the evidence of the Baori witnesses, Chhotiya (P.W. 8), Lachhuri (P.W. 10), Ladia (P.W. 11), Seruri (P.W. 12), Gangli (P.W. 13) and Pemla (P.W. 14) is consistent \"so far as these II accused are concerned regard- ing their beating 4 persons to death and causing injuries to Lachhuri, Ganesh's wife, Seruri and Chhotiya \"", "Later, he states      \"From the evidence of these                Baori witnesses................. it is found that these eleven accused were involved in the beating of the injured persons.\n ", "Whether they formed part of a bigger assembly is not now material because I have already discussed the cases of other accused and given them benefit of doubt.", "These eleven accused even amongst themselves being more than five in number could be regarded as members of an unlawful assembly\".", "But the learned Judge only accepted this story in part.", "He- believed Chhotiya (P.W. 8), Seruri (P.W. 12), Gangli (P.W.\n 13) and Pemla (P.W. 14) in so far as they stated that Sukha had a gun and that Sukha used it against Parsia and Mana, but he did not accept the evidence of Chhotiya (P.W. 8) in so far as he said that Gumana hit Chhotiya with a sword.", "He also rejected the prosecution version that the incidents occurred in two parts, first with a bigger assembly that beat all the accused and next with a smaller one that ran after Lachhuri and beat her and then returned to beat the others to death at the instigation of Sukha and Gumana.", "On this part of the case, the learned Sessions Judge found that \" whatever beating was done was done immediately after the scuffle between Chhotiya and Parsia and Sukha and Gumana and Gumana and Naraina, and those accused who had arrived on the spot.", "Nobody instigated anybody\".", "(Para 103).", "\n It was argued on behalf of the defence that the learned Sessions Judge discarded the evidence about 295 instigation in toto.", "Counsel for the State, however, contended that this passage refers to the second instigation which is said to have been given after the eleven had chased and beaten Lacbhuri and returned to finish off the others who were lying on the ground.", "We think that is right.", "\n In paragraph 101 of his judgment the learned Sessions Judge set out the fact that the prosecution witnesses divide the incidents into two parts: one in which a larger assembly beat all the injured persons and the other in which eleven killed the four deceased persons at the instigation of Sukha and Gumana.", "\n In paragraph 102 be set out reasons why he was not able to believe this story.", "The first was because \"Ladia (P.W. 11) did not state in his statement before the police that after beating Lachhuri, when ten or eleven persons had returned then at the instigation of Sukha and Gumana the injured were again beaten to death\".", "Then, after setting out four more reasons, the learned Judge reached the conclusion just enumerated in paragraph 103.", "\n In paragraph 117 he said- \"Leaving Begla and Govinda, I am fully convinced that Sukha, Gumana, Naraina, Kumla, Balia, Jeewana, Chokhla, Bhawana Khati and Jankiya did commit rioting with the common object of beating the Baories\".", "\nIn paragraph 118 he said- \"I am not convinced that the intention of all these accused was to murder the whole lot of Baories..............\"", "\nIn para 119-\"The accused did give sound beating to the injured\".", "\nHe concluded that no common object to kill could be deduced but held that a common object to beat was clear.", "As he was unable to determine which accused gave the fatal blows be convicted all under section 302 read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code.", "\nWe think it is clear from this judgment, read as a whole, that the learned Sessions Judge disbelieved 296 the story of instigation at any stage because if he had believed even the first instigation, a common object to kill would have emerged.", "\nWe are unfortunately not able to obtain much assistance from the judgment of the learned High Court Judges.", "They have not analysed the evidence and have not reached clear findings about a common object due in some measure to the fact that they do not appear to have appreciated the difference between a common object and a common intention.", "\nThey hold that six witnesses can be relied on to the extent that \"the villagers were armed with guns, swords, farsies and lathis\".", "They do not believe all that these witnesses say because they hold \"Though, therefore, we do not believe that these eleven persons deliberately murdered the four injured Baories who were lying there saying that they should be killed, there is no doubt in our minds that these eleven persons who have all been mentioned by these six witnesses were certainly seen taking more active part in this incident\".", "\nThen they hold- \"We are, therefore, satisfied on the statements of these witnesses that the incident took place in the main as stated by them and that the prosecution has given the right version of the affair\".", "\nNext, they hold that the fact that a large number of villagers, including the nine appellants, turned up armed with various weapons immediately they beard the quarrel between Chhotiya and Parsia on the one side and Gumana on the other \"shows that there must have been some consultation from before and that these persons arrived in prosecution of the common object..............\"", "\nAnd they add this reason: \"There is also the evidence of the prosecution witnesses that as the Baories came, some one or the other of these accused incited the rest of the villagers to beat up the Baories\".", "\nFrom this they conclude that there was an unlawful assembly with the common object of beating up the Baories.", "297 This is very unsatisfactory.", "The learned Judges were dealing with an appeal against an acquittal and though they have allowed the appeal they have not been specific about which part of the evidence they rely on in support of their findings nor do their conclusions follow logically-from the premises on which they are based.", "Take, for example, the finding about prior consultation.", "In the first place, no prior consultation is required when a common object is in question.", "The essence of the distinction between common object and common intention lies there.", "In the next place, the six witnesses, who are relied on, say that a crowd of 30 or 40 persons assembled.", "Among that crowd were Baories because three Baories (other than Parsia and Chhotiya) were killed and others injured.", "It is also evident that some of these Baories must have had some sort of weapons because three of the accused had slight injuries on their person and one a fracture.", "The evidence discloses that there had been thefts in t the village.", "The uproar occurred at 11 in the night.", "In those circumstances, it would be natural for the villagers to rush to the scene and arm themselves with whatever came to band.", "Some may have been motivated by an unlawful motive but many would not, and to deduce a common intention with prior concert in such circumstances is impossible.", "A common object is different and courts of fact are entitled to conclude on the evidence that has been accepted that some of those who rushed to the scene went there with the object of beating up persons whom they thought to be thieves and not merely to apprehend them or defend their properties; in other words, that some of those persons individually had an unlawful object in view.", "If each bad the same object, then their object would be common and if there were five or more with this object, then they would form an unlawful assembly without any prior concert among themselves.", "\nNext, take the High Court's finding about incitement.", "They have rejected the version given by the prosecution witnesses because they hold that the 298 story about the second beating is an improvement and also because they disbelieve the evidence that indicates that these eleven persons deliberately murdered the four injured Baories.", "\nBut the only evidence about incitement is that Sukha and Gumana called on the others to kill Barsia, and later to kill the others.", "The incitement was quite clearly to kill and not merely to beat.", "If this is rejected, then there is no evidence about incitement, so we are left in the dark to know what the learned Judges based their conclusion on.", "\nThat has left us with the task of finding whether there is, or could be, any proper basis for these convictions.", "\nNow, as we understand the learned Sessions Judge, he has believed the first part of the story which we have set out as step No. I except the portion that speaks about an incitement to kill.", "He finds that there was the meeting between Sukha and Gumana on the one side and Parsia and Chhotiya on the other.", "He says- \"It can safely be deduced from the incidents as related by the witnesses in this case that in the beginning the fighting was between a couple of persons only and on hearing their cries their relatives, friends and relations and other villagers reached the spot and some of the villagers did beat the Baories\".", "\nPausing there, it is evident that there was no unlawful assembly when the beating started; nor can it be deduced that all the persons who rushed to the scene, whether the number was 30 or 150, formed an unlawful assembly.", "We therefore have to scan the evidence carefully to see what happened after that.", "The finding is that the eleven accused who were charged for the murder were all involved in the beating of the injured persons.", "That satisfies one of the ingredients of rioting, namely the presence of five or more persons.", "But that of course is not enough.", "There must in addition, be an \"assembly\" and that assembly must have a \"common object\" and the object must be \"unlawful\".", "\nBut a common object is different from a common intention in that it does not require prior concert and 299 a common meeting of minds before the attack, and an unlawful object can develop after the people get there.", "It is not for us to re-assess the evidence in special leave.", "All we can say is that there are circumstances from which courts of fact could deduce that an unlawful object developed with more than five to share it once the marpit bad started; and as two courts of fact are satisfied that it did, there is no reason for us to interfere.", "Persons who had come there quite lawfully, in the first instance, thinking there were thieves could well have developed an intention to beat up the \"thieves\" instead of helping to apprehend them or defend their properties; and if five or more shared the object and joined in the beating, then the object of each would become the common object.", "\nThis is not to say that all those present were members of that assembly.", "The presumption of innocence would preclude such a conclusion.", "Those who rushed to the scene in the circumstances disclosed must be presumed to have gone there for a lawful purpose even if they were armed.", "The apprehension of marauders who prowl the town at night and the defence of person and property are lawful objects.", "But when that object is exceeded and persons begin to beat up the suspects the act of beating becomes unlawful, for private persons are no more entitled to beat and illtreat thieves than are the police, especially at a time when there is nothing beyond suspicion against them.", "But if five or more exceed the original lawful object and each has the same unlawful intention in mind and they act together and join in the beating, then they in themselves form an unlawful assembly.", "There is no difference in principle between this and a case in which the original object was unlawful.", "The only difference is that a case like this is more difficult to establish and must be scrutinised with greater care.", "But that scrutiny is here and we are satisfied that there is evidence in this case on which courts of fact could base the conclusion that they have reached.", "\nNow, did these eleven persons constitute an assembly or were they there individually without any 300 common factor to link them together?", "That, we think, is easily answered.", "It is clear that each (barring Sukha and Gumana who were already there) assembled at the spot because of the cries of Parsia and Chhotiya and because of the noise of the fight.", "That imports a common factor into their meeting and links them together as an assembly.", "Their object in assembling may have been innocent but the fact that a common factor like this induced them to come together constitutes them into an \"assembly\" though not, on that evidence alone, into an unlawful assembly.", "\nWe next have to see whether any of them had an unlawful object in view.", "The object of Sukha and Gumana was clearly unlawful.", "Now the evidence which has been believed shows that the other nine actually joined in the beating and that they did this after Sukha had fired his gun at Parsia and Parsia had fallen to the ground.", "It also shows that these others turned on Parsia's relations and friends when they came to their support.", "Therefore, whatever the original object of each may have been, it achieved a unity of purpose the moment the others joined in and continued to assist Sukha and Gumana and helped them to beat up the other Baories who came to Parsia's help.", "It is not a case of stray sporadic acts but indicates a certain continuity of purpose, each striving to achieve the same end, namely either to help Sukha and Gumana in beating up Parsia and Chhotiya and those who came to help them or to join in the beating for ends of their own.", "But the commonness of purpose is an inference of fact which courts of fact would be entitled to make.", "It does not matter whether the others joined in because of an initial instigation or whether, seeing the assault in progress, they joined in on their own account, because so long as each bad the object of beating up Parsia and Chhotiya and those who came to their assistance, that would make their object common.", "\nThe distinction between the common intention required by section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and the common object set out in section 149 lies just 301 there.", "In a case under section 149 there need not be a prior meeting of minds.", "It is enough that each has the same object in view and that their number is five or more and that they act as an assembly to achieve that object.", "All these features are to be found in that part of the evidence which has been believed.", "Therefore, on these findings which the courts of fact are entitled to reach, the object of the assembly was unlawful, but up to this point the highest common denominator was merely to beat and not to kill.", "Up to that point, the convictions of the learned Sessions Judge under section 325/149, Indian Penal Code, are unassailable.", "\nThe next question is whether, that being the case, the convictions by the High Court under section 302/149 can be upheld.", "\nNeither the Sessions Judge nor the High Court believe that there was any common intention to kill, therefore the convictions for the more serious offence can only be sustained under section 149 if it can be shown (1) that an actual killing of some of the persons attacked was likely to result from the beating which formed the common object and (2) that each person so convicted knew that might be a likely result.", "\nNow so far as Sukha and Gumana are concerned, there can be no doubt.", "They started the fight with deadly weapons.", "\nSukha fired at least twice and bit two persons.", "He himself may not have had an intention to kill and indeed the fact that the wounds are on non-vital parts must be used as a factor in his favour, but any person who carries a fire arm at that hour of the night and uses it and then continues a fight after an excited crowd has assembled and when at least nine of them rush in to join in the beating after his first shot must know either that somebody is likely to deal a fatal blow or at least that the cumulative effect of blows inflicted by a number of persons armed with lathis is likely to cause death from shock.", "Riots of this kind are common and death frequently results, therefore, not only was a killing a likely consequence of such an assault conducted in this fashion but Sukha and Gumana as men of ordinary intelligence must have known that.", "\n302 Much the same considerations apply in the case of the other appellants.", "They rushed in to hit persons who had already been fired on and who had been felled to the ground.", "They were in the midst of a crowd which could hardly have been calm and impassive and they joined in with several others to beat them up.", "Any man of reasonable intelligence would have known that somebody would be likely to be killed in a melee like that.", "Therefore, the requisite knowledge can be imputed to them also.", "\nTwo questions remain.", "One was directed against the reliability of that part of the evidence that has been believed.", "The argument, for all its repetition, length and eloquence, was the hackneyed one that when one part of a witness' evidence is disbelieved, it is unsafe to act on the rest of his testimony.", "The answer is equally hackneyed, namely that judges of fact have the right to do this and that this is not a court of appeal when it acts under article 136.", "The findings about this are concurrent, so, following our usual practice, we decline to review the evidence.", "\nThe other is that the absence of this in the charge occasioned prejudice.", "We have recently decided that we will be slow to entertain question of prejudice when details are not furnished; also the fact that the objection is not taken at an early stage will be taken into account.", "There is not a hint of prejudice in the petition filed by the appellants here in the High Court for leave to appeal to this Court; nor was this considered a ground for complaint in the very lengthy and argumentative petition for special leave filed in this Court.", "The only complaint about prejudice was on the score that there was no proper examination under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code.", "We decline to allow this matter to be raised.", "\nThe appeal fails and is dismissed."]}, {"labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1,

(hereinafter referred to as the asseessee company), for the years 1939-1940, 1940 1941, 1941-1942 and 1942-1943.", "\nThe facts leading up to the reference as found by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal are shortly as follows: The assessee company is a private limited company registered in the Mysore State under the Mysore Company Regulations and has its registered office at Sinduvalli in Mysore State.", "The management and control of the assessee company was vested in Messrs. Oakley Bowden & Co. (Madras) Ltd., another private limited company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, having its registered office at No.\n15, Armenian Street, Madras.", "The assessee company owns chromite mines in Mysore State.", "Chrome ores are extracted from the mines and converted into a merchantable product and then sold to buyers mostly outside India.", "A very small proportion of the total sales is effected in India and for the purposes of this case may be left out of consideration.", "\nThe sales are mostly to buyers in America and Europe.", "The sales to the purchasers in Europe are put through in London by Bowden Oakley & Co. Ltd., London, which is the agent of the assessee company in Europe holding a power of attorney from the assessee company.", "The contracts for sale to European purchasers are signed by Bowden Oakley & Co.

Madras or Marmagoa.", "A very small quantity of goods was sold F.O.B. Marmagoa and the same need not be considered here.", "Provision was made for weighment, sampling and assay of goods at destination.", "The terms of payment under the European contract were as follows:- Payment.-Buyers to open a confirmed irrevocable Bankers credit in favour of Messrs.

Balance estimated twenty (20 per cent.) of the margin due to be paid by telegraphic transfer through London on receipt of information as to assay and outturn which should be submitted within a month after the arrival of the steamer at destination, Charges for such telegraphic transfer for account of beneficiary.", "The European contracts also provided for insurance by buyers but no such provision was made in the American contracts.854", "The course of dealing as found by the Appellate Tribunal was as follows.", "Before the goods were actually shipped, the buyers used to open a confirmed irrevocable Bankers' credit with some first class bank in London.", "Being informed of the opening of such credit the Eastern Bank Ltd., London sent intimation to the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, and the latter in its turn used to pass on the intimation by letter addressed to the' assessee company.", "A specimen of such letter is also set out in the order of the Appellate Tribunal.", "in such communication the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, informed the assessee company that I 'in accordance with advices received by letter from our London Office, a confirmed and irrevocable credit has been opened in your favour by Messrs. Morgan Grenfell & Co., Ltd., London, for account of Messrs. W. R. Grace & Co., New York, for a sum not exceeding pound. 7,300 (seven thousand three hundred pounds sterling) in all, available by delivery to us on or before 15th January, 1940, of the following documents...............", "Towards, the end of the letter the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, used to write that they were \"prepared in our options as customary to negotiate drafts drawn in terms of the arrangement provided that the documents as above mentioned appear to us to be in order. \"", "\nThe letter concluded with a warning that the advice was \"given for your guidance and without involving any rosponsi- bility on the part of this Bank.", "\" On receipt of such intimation the assessee company placed the contracted goods on board the steamer at Madras and obtained A bill of lading in its own name.", "As already mentioned, the shipments were made principally at Madras Port.", "Thereafter, the assessee company used to make out a provisional invoice on the basis of the bill of lading weight and contract price for 48 per cent' Cr. 203 and used to draw a bill of exchange on the buyers Bank, where the letter of credit had been opened, for 90 per cent. of the amount of the provisional invoice payable at sight in the case of European contracts and 80 per cent. of the amount of the provisional invoice at 90 days' sight in the case of American contracts and in either case the bills of exchange used to be drawn in favour of theEastern 'Batik Ltd., London.", "The bill of exchange together with the relative bill of lading endorsed in blank by the assessee company and the provisional invoice was then negotiated with the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, the bankers of the assessee company, Who used to credit the assessee company with the amount of the bill of exchange.", "The Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, then forwarded the documents to the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, who used to present the bill of exchange to the buyers' Bank in London and upon the bill of exchange being accepted the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, used to deliver the bill of lading and the invoice to the buyers' Bank.", "The buyers Bank in due course used to pay the amount of the bill of exchange to the Eastern Bank Ltd., London.", "Thereafter, on arrival of the goods and' after weighment and assay, the sale price was ascertained and the balance of price, after deducting the payments made against the bill of exchange, used to be paid to the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, which was the assessee company's agent and banker in London.", "On the facts stated above the Income-tax Officer assessed the assessee company on the entire profits in respect of these sales on the footing that they arose and were also received in British India.", "On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed the assessment.", "The assessee company went up on appeal to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal.", "The Tribunal by its order dated the 22nd January, 1948, came to the conclusion that the sales took place outside British India and that the money in respect of such sales was also received by the agent of the.\nassessee company in London.", "The Commissioner of Income-tax thereupon applied to the Appellate Tribunal requiring the latter to state a case and refer certain questions of law said to &rise out of the order of the Tribunal.", "The Appellate Tribunal accordingly referred the two questions of law hereinbefore set out.", "The High Court of Madras in a well reasoned judgment upheld the decision of the Appellate Tribunal and answered the two questions in the affirmative and against the Commissioner of Income-tax.", "The Commissioner of Income-tax' has now preferredthis appeal with a certificate of fitness from the High Court.", "\nIt appears from the statement of case as also from the order of the Appellate Tribunal that it was agreed between the department and the assessee company that the income arose at the place, wherever that be, where, the sales took place.", "\nThis was not disputed before the High Court or before us although in the appellant's statement of case it was suggested that this was erroneous.", "The point for determination, therefore, is as to where the sales took place.", "Learned Solicitor-General appearing in support of this appeal contends that having regard to the terms of the contracts the sales must be regarded as having taken place in British India.", "The facts strongly relied on by him are (i) that the price and delivery of goods were on F.O.B.\nterms, (ii) that in the European contracts the insurance, if any, was to be the concern of the buyers and (iii) that payment of the 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. as the case may be was made in Madras by the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, to the assessee company on the delivery of the documents.", "All these facts taken together indicate, according to his submission, that the property in the goods passed at Madras and the sales accordingly were completed in British India.\n", "We are unable to accept this line of reasoning.", "According to section 4 of the Indian Sale of Goods Act a contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfer,% or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a price and where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer, the contract is called a sale, but where the transfer of property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to some condition thereafter to be fulfilled, the contract is called an agreement to sell.", "By sub-section (4) of that section an agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred.", "\nSection 18 of the Act clearly indicates that in the case of sale of unascertained goods no property in the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and until the goods, are ascertained.", "In 857, the present case, the contracts were always for sale of unascertained, goods.", "Skipping over sections 19 to 22 which deal with contract of sale of specific goods we come to section 23 which lays down that where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description and goods of that description and in a,, deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer.", "It is suggested that as soon as the assessee company placed the goods on board the steamer named by the buyer at the Madras Port the goods became ascertained and the property in the goods passed immediately to the buyer.", "This argument, however, overlooks the important word \"unconditionally\" used in the section.", "\nThe requirement of the section is not only that there shall be appropriation of the goods to the contract but that such appropriation must be made unconditionally.", "This is further elaborated by section 25 which provides that where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods or where goods are subsequently appropriated to the contract, the seller may, by the. terms. of the contract or appropriation,, reserve the right of disposal of the goods until certain conditions are fulfilled.", "In such a case, notwithstanding the delivery of the goods to the buyer, or to a carrier or other bailer for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, the property in the goods does not pass to the buyer until the conditions imposed by the seller are fulfilled.", "The question in this case, therefore, is: was there an unconditional appro- priation of the goods by merely placing them on the ship ?", "\nIt is true that the price and delivery was F.O.B., Madras but the contracts themselves clearly required the buyers to open a confirmed irrevocable Bankers' credit for, the requisite percentage of the invoice value to be available against documents.", "This clearly indicated that the buyers would not be entitled to the documents,, that is, the bill of lading and the provisional invoice, until payment of the requisite percentage was made upon the bill of exchange.", "\nThe bill of lading is the document of title to the goods and by this termthe assessee company clearly reserved the right of disposal, of the goods until the bill of exchange *as paid'.'", "Placing of the goods on board the steamer named by the buyer under a F.O.B. contract clearly discharges the contractual liability of the seller as seller and the delivery to the buyer is complete and the goods may thenceforward be also at the risk of the buyer against which he may cover himself by taking out an insurance.", "Prima facie such delivery of the goods to the buyer and the passing of the risk in respect of the goods from the seller to the buyer are strong indications as to the passing also of the property in the goods to the buyer but they are not decisive and may be negatived, for under section 25 the seller may yet reserve to himself the right of disposal of the goods until the fulfilment of certain conditions and thereby prevent the passing of property in the goods from him to the buyer.", "The facts found in this case are that the assessee company shipped the goods under bill of lading issued in its own name.", "Under the contract it was not obliged to part with the bill of lading which is the document of title to the goods until the bill of exchange drawn by it on the buyers' Bank where the irrevocable letter of credit was opened was honoured.", "It is urged that under the provision in the contract for weighment and assay, which was ultimately to fix the price unless the buyer rightly rejected the goods as not being in terms of the contract, the passing of property in the goods could not take place until the buyer accepted the goods and the price was fully ascertained after weighment and assay.", "It is submitted that being the position, the property in the goods passed and the sales were concluded outside British India, for the weighment, sampling, assay and the final fixation of the price could only take place under all these contracts outside British India.", "It is not necessary for us to express any opinion on this extreme contention.", "Suffice it to say, for the purposes of this case, that in any event upon the terms of the contracts in question and the course of dealings between the parties the property in the goods could not have passed to the buyer earlier than the date when the bill of exchange was accepted by the buyers' Bank in London and thedocuments were delivered by the assessee company's agent, the Eastern Bank Ltd., London, to the buyers\" Bank.", "This admittedly, and as found by the Appellate, Tribunal, always took place in London.", "It must, therefore,. follow that at the earliest the ;property in the goods passed in London where the bill of lading was handed over to the buyers' Bank against the acceptance of the relative bill of exchange.", "In the premises, the Appellate Tribunal as well as the High Court were quite correct in holding that the sales took place outside British India and, ex hypothesis the profits derived from such sales arose outside British India.", "\nAs to the second question, the.. learned Solicitor-General contends that irrespective of the place where the sale may have. taken place the profits derived from such sales were received in Madras.", "It is recalled that after shipment the assessee company, through its managing agent in Madras, prepared, provisional invoices and drew bills of exchange for 80 per cent. or 90 per cent., as the case may be, of the amount of such invoices and handed over the same to the Eastern Bank Ltd., Madras, and received the amount of the bill of exchange from them in Madras.", "He contends that the receipt of this payment by the assessee company was really the receipt of the price of the goods and amounted to receipt of profits in Madras.", "He draws our attention to the terms of payment in the European contract and to the letter of intimation of the opening of the credit sent by the Eastern Bank Ltd.

result and various indirect and sophisticated methods are being used to 'avoid leaving any evidence of the offence.", "Similarly, the conse- quences of non-fulfilment of the demand of dowry meted out to the unfortunate bride takes different forms to avoid any apparent causal connection between the demand of dowry and its prejudicial effect on the bride.", "This experience has led to several other

pricing adjustment on merits without specifically raising the objection of jurisdiction of the TPO to examine the said transaction in absence of a specific reference by the Assessing Officer.", "Be

Before deciding the rival contentions, we may record that learned counsel Mr. Chhotaray for the department had raised an objection to the very maintainability of this petition contending that the petition is filed at a premature stage.", "\nHis argument was that whatever be the nature of the order passed by the TPO, the petitioner must be reletgated to the departmental proceedings and thereafter, appeal.", "At this stage, the Court should not examine the legality or otherwise of the report of the TPO.", "\n 4. We would first deal with this preliminary objection of the department.", "It is well settled through series of judgments of the High Courts and Supreme Court that writ jurisdiction of the High Courts in exercise of powers under Article 226 of Constitution of India is extremely wide.", "If a jurisdictional error is pointed out or it is shown that an authority has acted wholly without jurisdiction, the Court can, without relegating the petitioner to the departmental or even statutory remedies, strike down exercise of such powers.", "In case of Calcutta Discount Co Ltd Vs. ITO & Anr.1, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the context of a notice of reopening of assessment issued by the Assessing Officer had held and observed that, though the writ of prohibition or certiorary will not issue against an executive authority, the High Courts have power to issue in a fit case an order prohibiting an executive authority from acting 1 41 ITR 191 without jurisdiction.", "Where such action of an executive authority acting without jurisdiction subjects or is likely to subject a person to lengthy proceedings and unnecessary harassment, the High Courts, it is well settled, will issue appropriate orders or directions to prevent such consequences.", "The existence of such alternative remedy is not however always a sufficient reason for refusing a party quick relief by a writ or order prohibiting an authority acting without jurisdiction from continuing such action.", "It was further observed that, when the Constitution confers on the High Courts the power to give relief it becomes the duty of the courts to give such relief in fit cases and the courts would be failing to perform their duty if relief is refused without adequate reasons.", "It is not necessary to refer to large number of authorities on the point in this context.", "\nTherefore, if we find that the action of the TPO or a part of it which can be severed from the rest was wholly without jurisdiction, we would not hesitate in striking down such order or part thereof merely because the statute provides certain appeal remedies to the aggrieved assessee.", "\n 5. In this background, we may first advert to the transfer pricing adjustment in relation to the payment of creditors in demerger process.", "We may recall, admitted position is that the petitioner, holding a belief that this transaction was not a specified domestic transaction, had not reported the same in the form 3CEB.", "The reference made by the Assessing Officer to the TPO was confined to those specified domestic transactions reported by the petitioner.", "Consequently, undisputed fact that emerges from the record is that this transaction was not part of the reference made by the Assessing Officer.", "In this context, the question arises whether the TPO could have on his own, suo motu examined the transaction and made transfer pricing adjustment in his order.", "\n 6. Chapter X of the Act", "pertains to special provisions relating to avoidance of tax.", "Section 92 contained in the said chapter pertains to computation of income from international transaction having regard to arm's length price.", "As is well known, when these transfer pricing provisions were initially introduced in the Act, only international transactions were brought within fold of transfer pricing mechanism.", "\nSubsequently, several amendments were made in the provisions contained in Chapter X by Finance Act, 2012 bringing within the fold of transfer pricing mechanism certain domestic transactions.", "Sub-section (2A) inserted in Section 92 of the Act by Finance Act 2012 w.e.f. 1.4.2013 provides that any allowance for an expenditure or interest or allocation of any cost or expense or any income in relation to the specified domestic transaction shall be computed having regard to the arm's length price.", "Clause (ii) of Section 92F defines the term 'arm's length price'.", "The meaning of term 'associated enterprise' is provided in Section 92A.

Section 92E requires every person who has entered into an international transaction or a specified domestic tranasaction during a previous year to obtain a report from an accountant and furnish the report on or before the specified date in the prescribed form and verified in specified manner containing particulars as may be prescribed.", "\n 9. Analysis of above noted statutory provisions would show that under sub-section (1) of Section 92CA, where any person has entered into an international transaction or specified domestic transaction in any previous year and the Assessing Officer considers it necessary or expedient so to do, he may, with the previous approval of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner refer the computation of arm's length price in relation to such transaction under Section 92C to the TPO.", "Two things may be noted at this stage.", "The group of words \"or specified domestic transaction\" were added to the said sub-section by Finance Act 2012 w.e.f. 1.4.2013.", "Secondly, the reference that the Assessing Officer may make to the TPO in this sub-section would be with the previous approval of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner.", "\n 10.

One thing therefore, that can be safely concluded is that the legislature while making amendments in various provisions contained in Chapter X of the Act, covering the cases of specified domestic transactions in transfer pricing mechanism, did not make any such corresponding change in sub-sections (2A) or (2B) of Section 92CA.", "We may recall, sub-section (2A) was inserted by Finance Act of 2011.", "\nTherefore, when under Finance Act of 2012, the specified domestic transactions were being made subject to transfer pricing mechanism, there was no reason for the legislature, if so thought necessary, to include a reference to specified domestic transaction under sub-section (2A).", "More significant indication of the conscious legislative process is the fact that sub-section (2B) was inserted under the same Finance Act of 2012 by which the specified domestic transactions became subject matter of transfer pricing mechanism.", "We must, therefore, presume that the legislature consciously decided not to include a reference to a specified domestic transaction under sub-section (2A) and (2B) of Section 92CA.\n 13.", "It is indisputable that by virtue of sub-sections (2A) and (2B) of Section 92CA, in case of an international transaction, the TPO would have an authority to examine any international transaction which comes to his notice during the proceedings, whether a reference in this respect was made by the Assessing Officer or not and whether the assessee had reported such transaction under Section 92E of the Act or not.", "However, in view of specific non-inclusion of the specified domestic transaction under the said sub- sections, in so far as the domestic transactions are concerned, the situation would be vastly different.", "\n 14. In plain terms, in absence of sub-sections (2A) and (2B) of Section 92CA, the TPO would get jurisdiction to examine a transaction whether it is international or specified domestic transaction, only upon reference being made by the Assessing Officer under sub-section (1) of Section 92CA of the Act.", "Sub-section (2) of Section 92CA provides that where a reference is made under sub-section (1), the TPO would serve a notice to the assessee requiring him to furnish details in relation to international transaction or specified domestic transaction referred to in sub-section (1).", "Thus, the jurisdiction of the TPO to issue a notice to the assessee would be in relation to international transaction or specified domestic transaction for which reference is made by the Assessing Officer under sub-section (1).", "It is precisely for this reason that sub-sections (2A) and (2B) provide a deeming fiction where they provide that in case of an international transaction not referred to the TPO or an international transaction not reported by the assessee, which comes to his notice during the proceedings, the provision of the Chapter would apply as if such international transaction was one referred to in sub-section (1).", "In absence of this deeming fiction, it would not be open for the TPO to exercise the powers under the said chapter in relation to the transaction not referred to him.", "The reference to be made by the Assessing Officer", "is not an empty formality.", "Said reference has to be made only on approval of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner.", "Legislature, requires the Assessing Officer to obtain an approval from senior Revenue Authority before a reference is made.", "Such requirement cannot be jettisoned by the TPO exercising sue motu jurisdiction over the transaction not reported to him.", "\n 15. This Court in case of Vodafone India Services Pvt Ltd Vs.

Learned counsel for the Revenue is correct in pointing out that in the present case, the assessee did not report such transaction at all and therefore, the Assessing Officer had no occasion to notice such transaction as specified domestic transaction.", "His reference, therefore, was necessarily confined to the reported transactions.", "The TPO noticed this anomaly, he proceeded to determine the arm's length price after full opportunity of hearing to the petitioner.", "\n 19. Even in such a situation, the statute does not permit the TPO to assume the jurisdiction to determine the arm's length price of a specified domestic transaction not reported to him.", "There may be number of cases where the assessee may bonafide hold a belief that certain transaction is not a specified domestic transaction and therefore, would not report the same under Section 92E of the Act.", "Whether bonafide or not, not making a report by the assessee of a specified domestic transaction would not leave the revenue without remedy.", "As clarified by CBDT in the instructions dated 20.5.2013, it is always open for the TPO who notices such transaction during the course of the proceedings before him to call for a reference by the Assessing Officer.", "If the Assessing Officer does make a report, only then TPO can undertake further steps as envisaged under sub-section (2) and other sub-sections of Section 92CA.", "As noted, the statute is sufficiently clear.", "The legislature while expanding the scope of the transfer pricing study by the TPO to a transaction not referred him or not reported by the Assessing Officer, under sub-section (2A) and (2B) of Section 92CA, has confined the applicability thereof only to international transactions.", "The TPO exercising such powers suo motu in relation to a specified domestic transaction would be transgressing his jurisdiction and in the process would render the requirement of sub-section (1) of Section 92CA redundant.", "As noted, the reference that the Assessing Officer can make to the TPO would have the approval of the Principal Commissioner or the Commissioner.", "\n 20. Under these circumstances, in relation to the transaction of payment to creditors in demerger process, the TPO had no jurisdiction to make any adjustments.", "Under these circumstances and even otherwise, we are not inclined to examine the adjustment on merits though it was argued before us by the learned counsel for the petitioner.", "\n 21. Coming to the adjustment made by the TPO towards payment of subscription fees, even though the petitioner may have certain arguable points, that by itself, would not enable us to bypass the entire statutory scheme of assessment, appeal and revision.", "Once the TPO makes his report, the provisions are made in the statute how such report would be acted upon", ". The petitioner would have full innings to oppose the contents of such report and take such challenge in the appeal in case the petitioner fails at the first stage.", "When a statute that too, fiscal statute makes detail provisions for assessment, appeals and revisions, ordinarily the Court would not examine the issues on merits bypassing such statutory remedies.", "Reference in this respect can be made to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of CIT Vs. Chhabil Dass Agarwal3.", "In the said judgment taking note of the larger number of decisions of the Supreme Court in context of exercising writ jurisdiction when statutory appeal remedies are available, it was observed as under:- \"19.", "Thus, while it can be said that this Court has recognized some exceptions to the rule of alternative remedy, i.e., where the statutory authority has not acted in accordance with the provisions of the enactment in question, or in defiance of the fundamental principles of judicial procedure, or has resorted to invoke the provisions which are repealed, or when an order has been passed in total violation of the principles of natural justice, the proposition laid down in Thansingh Nathmal's case, Titagarh Paper Mills' case and other similar judgments that the High Court will not entertain a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution if an effective alternative remedy is available to the aggrieved person or the statute under which the action complained of has been taken itself contains a mechanism for 3 [2013] 357 (SC) redressal of grievance still holds the field.", "Therefore, when a statutory forum is created by law for redressal of grievances, a writ petition should not be entertained ignoring the statutory dispensation.", "\n All the contentions on merits raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner in relation to this adjustment require minute examination of documents and materials on record and accounts.", "Even the contention of breach of natural justice is not possible of summary consideration.", "The TPO had issued several notices during the proceedings.", "\nWhether precise query was raised in relation to the adjustment ultimately suggested would require minute and detailed examination of documents on record, an exercise we are not inclined to undertake in this petition.", "When the Act provides for statutory appeals and further appeal to the High Court on substantial question of law, such exercise, we would be well advised not to undertake in a writ petition.", "\n 22. In view of the above discussion, the impugned order of the TPO is quashed in so far as it provides adjustment of the arm's length price towards payment of creditors in demerger process of a sum of Rs. 57.54 crores.", "Rest of the impugned order stands as it is.", "\n 23.

Much emphasis has been given by the learned counsel for the appellant on Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in Laxman Vs.

State of Gujarat, (1999) 9 SCC 562.", "The facts of the case and conflicting views expressed in the above two cases has been noticed in Paragraph Nos. 1 and 2, which are to the following effect:- \"In this criminal appeal, the conviction of the accused-appellant is based upon the dying declaration of the deceased which was recorded by the Judicial Magistrate (PW 4).", "The learned Sessions Judge as well as the High Court held the dying declaration made by the deceased to be truthful, voluntary and trustworthy.", "The Magistrate in his evidence had stated that he had contacted the patient through the medical officer on duty and after putting some ques- tions to the patient to find out whether she was able to make the statement; whether she was set on fire; whether she was conscious and able to make the statement and on being satis- fied he recorded the statement of the de- ceased.", "There was a certificate of the doctor which indicates that the patient was con- scious.", "The High Court on consideration of the evidence of the Magistrate as well as on the certificate of the doctor on the dying decla- ration recorded by the Magistrate together with other circumstances on record came to the conclusion that the deceased Chandrakala was physically and mentally fit and as such the dying declaration can be relied upon.", "When the appeal against the judgment of the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court was placed be- fore a three-Judge Bench of this Court, the counsel for the appellant relied upon the de- cision of this Court in the case of Paparam- baka Rosamma v. State of A.P., (1999) 7 SCC 695 and contended that since the certification of the doctor was not to the effect that the patient was in a fit state of mind to make the statement, the dying declaration could not have been accepted by the Court to form the sole basis of conviction.", "On behalf of the counsel appearing for the State another three- Judge Bench decision of this Court in the case of Koli Chunilal Savji v. State of Gujarat (1999) 9 SCCC 562 was relied upon wherein this Court has held that if the materials on record indicate that the deceased was fully conscious and was capable of making a statement, the dy- ing declaration of the deceased thus recorded cannot be ignored merely because the doctor had not made the endorsement that the deceased was in a fit state of mind to make the state- ment in question.", "Since the two aforesaid de- cisions expressed by two Benches of three learned Judges was somewhat contradictory the Bench by order dated 27-7-2002 referred the question to the Constitution Bench.", "\n 2. At the outset we make it clear that we are only resolving the so-called conflict be- tween the aforesaid three-Judge Bench decision of this Court, whereafter the criminal appeal will be placed before the Bench presided over by Justice M.B. Shah who had referred the mat- ter to the Constitution Bench.", "We are, there- fore, refraining from examining the evidence on record to come to a conclusion one way or the other and we are restricting our consider- ations to the correctness of the two decisions referred to supra.\"\n 14.", "The Constitution Bench approved the view taken by later judgment in Koli Chunilal Savji (supra).   ", "In Paragraph No. 5, following has been laid down:- \"5.", "The Court also in the aforesaid case relied upon the decision of this Court in Har- jit Kaur v. State of Punjab4 wherein the Mag- istrate in his evidence had stated that he had ascertained from the doctor whether she was in a fit condition to make a statement and ob- tained an endorsement to that effect and merely because an endorsement was made not on the declaration but on the application would not render the dying declaration suspicious in any manner.", "For the reasons already indicated earlier, we have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the observations of this Court in Paparambaka Rosamma v. State of A.P.\n(1999) 7 SCC 695 (at SCC p. 701, para 8) to the effect that \"in the absence of a medical certi- fication that the injured was in a fit state of mind at the time of making the declaration, it would be very much risky to accept the sub- jective satisfaction of a Magistrate who opined that the injured was in a fit state of mind at the time of making a declaration\"\n has been too broadly stated and is not the correct enunciation of law.", "It is indeed a hy- pertechnical view that the certification of the doctor was to the effect that the patient is conscious and there was no certification that the patient was in a fit state of mind especially when the Magistrate categorically stated in his evidence indicating the ques- tions he had put to the patient and from the answers elicited was satisfied that the pa- tient was in a fit state of mind whereafter he recorded the dying declaration.", "Therefore, the judgment of this Court in Paparambaka Rosamma v. State of A.P. (1999) 7 SCC 695 must be held to be not correctly decided and we affirm the law laid down by this Court in Koli Chuni- lal Savji v. State of Gujarat (1999) 9 SCC 562.\"", "\n 15. The view expressed by Three-Judge Bench in Paparambaka Rosamma (supra) that in the absence of medical certification that the injured was in a fit state of mind at the time of making the declaration, it would be very much risky to accept the subjective satisfaction of a Magistrate who opined that the injured was in a fit state of mind at the time of making a declaration, does not lay down a correct law.", "Thus, the Constitution bench was only considering the question of nature of medical certification regarding fitness of victim to make a dying declaration.", "The proposition laid down in the above case does not in any manner support the contention raised by the counsel for the appellant in the present case.", "Present is a case where a statement was recorded by I.O. under Section 161 of the victim on 05.12.1990.", "Both the trial court and the High Court held the statement relevant and placed reliance on the said statement.", "\n 16. We have noticed that this Court has laid down that statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C., which is covered under Section 32(1) is relevant and admissible.", "Thus, we do not find any error in the judgment of the trial court as well as of the High Court in relying on the statement of the injured recorded by the I.O. on 05.12.1990.", "It is also relevant to notice that I.O. in his cross-examination has stated that he went on the night of 30.11.1990 to the Medical College to record the statement but as his condition was serious, he was not examined.", "Thus, reliance on the statement made on 05.12.1990 to the I.O. does not lead to any suspicious circumstances so as to discard the value of such statement.", "The statement, which was made by the victim on 05.12.1990 was to the following effect:- \"My name is Bhaskar Sahu, S/o. Kaibalya Sahu, present/permanent Resident of Village - Langal Dei, P.S. Digapahandi Dist.

The trial court after appreciation of evidence recorded the findings that deceased had acid injuries as well as bomb blast injuries.", "In the acid attack, he has lost his eye-sight and also lost his right foot.", "The trial court has rightly held that statement of deceased made on 05.12.1990 is admissible under Section 32 because it is regarding his cause of death and how he was injured.", "In para 8 of the judgment, trial court has recorded as follows:- \"8. From the medical report it is clear that the deceased was having acid injury and bomb blasting injury and during the treatment he died in the hospital.", "Now it is to be seen who has caused those acid and bomb blast injuries on the person of the deceased.", "There is no eye witness to the occurrence.", "The deceased had given information to the P.W.1 and also to the I.O.", "P.W.1 says that he learnt from the deceased that accused assaulted him and threw acid on his face, and other parts of his body and he reported the matter to the police, after knowing the fact from the deceased, vide Ext. 12.", "It is also clear from the evidence of P.W.3 that he carried the deceased to the hospital, who had sustained injuries.", "The statement of the deceased to P.W.1 is admissible under 32 of the Evidence Act.", "Because, it gives regarding his cause of death and how he was injured.\"", "\n 18. The injuries on the body of deceased fully support the prosecution case.", " The statement made by the deceased on 05.12.1990, thus, finds corroboration from the injuries on the body of deceased and the sequences of the events and manner of incidents as claimed by the prosecution.", "The PW1, the informant has fully supported the prosecution case.", "\n 19. The High Court while dismissing the appeal has also made observation that conviction and sentence of the accused was for a lesser offence and lenient one.", "\n 20.

was it less than Rs. 3,00,000 or more?", "\n         Column 3 of the Table appended to the Notification dated 29.1.1985 issued under Section 4-A of the Act shows that in respect of the units mentioned therein in Serial No.\n3, the exemption should for three years if the total capital investment does not exceed Rs. 3,00,000 and if it exceeds Rs. 3,00,000 it should be five years.", "The petitioners' case throughout has been that they purchased and installed a diesel unit on 4.3.1985 amounting to Rs. 72,800 and that since the same is not in dispute at all, it must be held that the cost of the diesel unit should be included in the capital investment, and then the total capital investment would be more than Rs. 3,00,000 as on the date of first sale namely 30.3.1985, in which case the exemption should be for five years.", "We may mention here that this point was not considered by the High Court in the manner it is submitted by the petitioners.", "No doubt, before the High Court the petitioners' contention was that the date 20.5.86, when the power was supplied, should be the date of starting of production and from that date the exemption should be for five years.", "The High Court rejected this contention by observing: \"The petitioners did not aver specifically that even on 1.3.1985/30.3.1985, their investment was more than rupees three lacks.", "In such a situation, we cannot find fault with the authority for not recording a clear find on this issue\".\n         ", "In observing so, the High Court relied on two paragraphs in the 599 review petition filed before the Sales Tax Authorities.", "The learned counsel submitted that even if the period of exemption cannot be reckoned from 20.5.86 (the date on which the power was supplied), yet the same should be reckoned atleast from 30.3.1985, on which date the total capital investment was above Rs. 3,00,000 undoubtedly.", "The learned counsel for the State submitted that such a contention was not put forward by the petitioners before the High Court and, therefore, the petitioners cannot raise the same before this Court.", "\n The High Court has given a categorical finding as under: \"In the circumstances of the present case, we find that the date of starting production in the petitioners unit is 1.3.1985 and in view of sub- section (1) of section 4-A, the date of the first sale, i.e., 30.3.1985, should be taken as the date of commencement of the period of exemption, the same falling within six months of the date of starting production\".", "(emphasis supplied)", "Therefore, 30.3.1985 should be the date of commencement of the period of exemption.", "In the review petition filed before the Joint Director of Industries, no doubt, it is clearly mentioned that on 19.4.1986 the capital investment was Rs. 5,26,273 and that the Sales Tax Officer cannot reduce the capital investment by excluding the cost of diesel set.", "But in the counter-affidavit filed by the State Government before the High Court, it is mentioned thus: \"The dealer filed a review application before the Joint Director of Industries stating that exemption should be granted w.e.f. 30.3.85, the date of first sale.", "It was also stated that capital investment upto 30.3.85 was more than 3 lacks including generator for Rs. 72,800 purchase vide Bill No.\n 107/84-85 dt. 4.3.85.", "Regarding this application enquiries were made and it was found that dealer started production from 1.3.85 manually and he had not purchased any machine driven by power before 1.3.85 and generator was purchased locally on 4.3.85 i.e. after the date of starting production vide Bill No. 107/84-85 dated 4.3.85 for Rs. 72,800 by transfer of documents against form `C'.\n ", "Therefore, investment in the generator cannot be included in the machinary investment because the generator was not used 600 for production.\"", "Relying on these admissions, the learned counsel submitted that it is an admitted fact that the Bill dated 4.3.85 which is for Rs. 72,800 in respect of the diesel set purchased should be included in the capital investment and that the Joint Director excluded that amount on the wrong assumption that the exemption period should be counted from the date of production and the total investment as on that day alone is relevant which is erroneous.", "From the above material it cannot be said that this aspect was not an issue before the High Court but the same lost its significance in view of the larger claim made by the petitioners that the exemption should be from 20.5.86.", "The learned counsel for the State, however, submits that the matter may be remanded.", "We do not think it is necessary to do so in view of the cogent and clear material, which cannot be controverted.", "\n Before proceeding we may extract the order which was impugned before the High Court: \"Letter No. 8971                   DS/8/Sales Tax/88-89 Office Joint Director Industries(D.S.)

Relief for respondent in divorce and other proceedings.", "In any proceedings for divorce or judicial separation or restitution of conjugal rights, the respondent may not only oppose the relief sought on the ground of petitioner's adultery, cruelty or desertion, but also make a counterclaim for any relief under this Act on the ground, and if the petitioner's adultery, cruelty or desertion is proved the Court may give to the respondent any relief if he or she had presented a petition seeking such relief on that ground.\"\n ", "On a fair reading of the aforesaid provision it is graphically clear that a special provision of this nature provides for counterclaim in respect of a divorce petition.", "\n     Thus, provision of Order 8 Rule 6A of the Code shall not be applicable, in view of the provisions enshrined under Section 23A of the Act. \"\n 12.
